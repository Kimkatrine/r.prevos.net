The influence of visionaries such as Frederick Taylor, Elton Mayo and W. Edwards Deming is, however, immense as their ideas were <a href=""https://horizonofreason.com/management-philosophy/"">instrumental</a> in creating the prosperity of the late twentieth century. Have these management thinkers found the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-alchemy/"">philosopher's stone of management</a> or did they spawn management fundamentalism?

<h2>Frederick Taylor</h2>

Frederick Taylor (1856<96>1915) was born to a wealthy Quaker family in Philadelphia and was raised with traditional Protestant values, which espouse hard work and discipline. Childhood friends recall him analysing everything, even a game of croquet or rounders. His passion for perfection and sport was rewarded when in 1881 Taylor and his brother in law became the first men's double US tennis champions. Although passing the entry exam for Harvard University, Taylor did not attend the alma mater of his family. Instead, he became an apprentice pattern maker and machinist in 1873. Five years later, he was employed at the Midvale Steel Company as a labourer and worked his way up to chief engineer in six years. While working at Midvale, Taylor obtained a degree in Mechanical Engineering through part-time study at the Stevens Institute of Technology.[note]Gabor, Andrea (2000) <em>The capitalist philosophers.</em> New York: Three Rovers Press.[/note]

Taylor's thinking was emblematic of the rationalist and pragmatic spirit of the late nineteenth century. It was a time when the successes of the exact sciences led to the belief that this type of thinking also applies to the social sciences. The Hobbesian view of society as a machine and the fact that psychology was only an embryonic science, profoundly influenced Taylor's thinking. Society was thrown into disarray because of the rapid transition from small-scale traditional social systems to the sprawling cities of the industrial age.

This development was combined with an increase in individualism, following the call of enlightenment philosophers such as Immanuel Kant for people to think for themselves.[note]Kant, Immanuel (1784), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_is_Enlightenment%3F"">Was ist Aufkl<e4>rung?</a>[/note] It was also a time of rapid vertical economic growth for the United States, spearheaded by the construction of an extensive railway network, which enabled manufacturers to develop high-density distribution networks. Economic activity focused on increasing production because of the intense hunger for goods, which required the improvement of manufacturing techniques to keep up with demand. President Roosevelt remarked in this context that: ""The conservation of our national resources is only preliminary to the larger question of national efficiency.""

It was these words that Taylor used to open his most influential 1911 monograph, <em>The Principles of Scientific Management</em>. Taylor developed his management theory when encountering the practice of <93>systematic soldiering<94>, which is the intentional limitation of productivity by labourers, at the Midvale Steel Works. Taylor's protestant ethic emphasising diligent labour as a means to personal salvation and upper-class upbringing prevented him from accepting this ingrained practice.

Taylor's motives were outwardly humanistic as he aimed to ""secure the maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee. Taylor's focus on increasing productivity was based on the idea that <93>maximum prosperity can exist only as the result of maximum productivity<94>.[note]Taylor, Frederick W. (19110) <em>The principles of scientific managem</em>ent.[/note] Contemporary marketing literature suggests a variety of means to increase prosperity, such as communications and pricing strategies. These sophisticated marketing strategies were, however, not generally practised during Taylor's time and so his only means to improve prosperity was to increase efficiency.

Taylor observed that factory workers had their trade handed down through word of mouth and he lamented that this <93>rule of thumb<94> knowledge, was <93>not in possession of the management<94>.[note]Ibid.[/note] Taylor's strategy was therefore principally aimed at transferring power from the worker to management and develop a science to replace traditional knowledge. Although Taylor mentions <93>an almost equal division of the responsibility between management and the workmen [sic]<94>,[note]Ibid.[/note] his idea of shared responsibility was to move all initiative and control over work methods from labourers to management. His attitude towards labourers is reminiscent of Kant's Vorm<fc>nder (guardians),[note]Kant, 1785.[/note] as he does not want them to think for themselves. Taylor's ideal factory is like a termite colony; using rigid work patterns which convert employees into mindless workers.[note]Pech, Richard J. (2001) 'Termites, group behaviour, and the loss of innovation: conformity rules!' <em>Journal of Managerial Psychology</em> 16(7): 559<96>574.[/note]

Taylor and his colleagues ran a series of experiments with hauling pig iron. His description of this activity shows disdain, rooted in his sense of class distinctions, for the average worker: <93><85> it would be possible to train an intelligent gorilla to become a more efficient pig-iron handler than any man can be<94> [note]Taylor, 1911.[/note], thereby justifying his strict division of labour. Using an early application of ergonomics, Taylor determined that pig iron hauliers should be able to move 48 metric tonnes per day (1,144 pigs of iron), instead of the usual 13 tonnes (304 pigs). The workers were offered a salary increase from $1.15 per day to $1.85. [note]Ibid.[/note] To the labourers, a sixty percent wage increase would have sounded fantastic, but they had to increase productivity by 376%! Taylor justified this by arguing that customers should enjoy part of the productivity gains, but he also thought that labourers would not be able to handle earning too much money and that they would become <93>extravagant and dissipated<94>.[note]Ibid.[/note]

Taylor had, however, great difficulty implementing his theories and occasionally resorted to lowering wages to ""motivate"" workers and using a form of Social Darwinism to weed out all those who were not able to achieve the high production standards. Taylor's experiments were not received favourably; workers threw spanners in the works and Taylorism was also subject to a congressional investigation. In spite of this resistance, Taylorism remained popular for several decades.

<h2>Elton Mayo</h2>

Australian born psychologist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Mayo"">Elton Mayo</a> (1880<96>1949) was asked in 1928 to help interpret the data obtained from the Hawthorne experiments. Mayo was a proponent of the psychology of Sigmund Freud and challenged the idea of people as purely rational beings. This in contrast with Taylor, who relied upon mathematical reasoning to improve management practices and analysed people as if they were machines.[note]Wren, David A. (2005) <em>The history of management thought</em>. 5th ed. Wiley.[/note]

The experiments conducted at the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric were initially performed to investigate the relationships between workplace conditions and productivity. One hypothesis productivity maximises at a particular light intensity had to be rejected, as productivity increased regardless of light intensity. The researchers concluded that uncontrolled variables had influenced productivity and eventually concluded that the psychology of the total situation was an important factor.

It could be argued that Taylor foretold the outcomes of Hawthorne. When working at the Simmonds Rolling Machine Company, he noted that productivity increased when: <93>each [ball bearing checking] girl was made to feel that she was the object of special care and interest<94>. However, Taylor has never conducted any detailed studies to investigate this phenomenon.

One of the variables Mayo and his colleagues studied at Hawthorne was the influence of rest periods on productivity. This was, however, not a new idea as Taylor had introduced regular rest periods for the ball bearing checking girls and noted that productivity increased. Taylor's perspective was, however, not psychological but ergonomic. He was interested in improving the efficiency of the human machine, without regarding the mind.

Mayo also encountered the practice of soldiering at Hawthorne. Researchers found that a group of workers paid on a piece-rate arrangement had established their output norm, based on what they thought would be fair. In contrast with Taylor, Mayo did not seek to eradicate the informal organisation. Instead, he tried to find ways to create an equilibrium between the official and informal organisation.

<h2>W. Edwards Deming</h2>

The founder of Total Quality Management, W. Edwards Deming (1900<96>1993) was imbued with Taylor's systematic approach, but with a more enlightened understanding of human psychology. To improve the pig-iron loading, Deming would have advised Taylor to motivate workers to provide suggestions to increase efficiency, rather than relying on stopwatch and slide-rule yielding engineers. Taylor's hierarchical view of the world and his belief in a strict division of responsibility impeded him from recognising workers as part of the solution. Taylor's writings are, however, contradictory, because he does seem to believe that <93>every encouragement <85> should be given [to the worker] to suggest improvements<94>,[note]Taylor, 1911.[/note] contradicting with his ideas about the division of labour cited above.

There are many points of difference and similarities between Deming and Taylor. They both used a method based on science and placed high value on facts. They also both saw that management and employees have similar interests and both acknowledged the importance of customers. Their points of difference are due to their place on the timeline of management thought. Deming had the advantage of the psychological insights of management researchers such as Mayo, while Taylor was limited by his belief in the exact sciences and the limited availability of psychological knowledge.[note]Knouse, Stephen B., Carson, Paula Phillips and Carson, Kerry D. (1993) 'W. Edward Deming and Frederick Winslow Taylor: A Comparison of two leaders who shaped the world's view of management'.<em> International Journal of Public Administration</em> 16(10): 1621<96>1658.[/note]

The currently widely implemented Six Sigma business improvement methodology echoes the philosophy of Scientific Management. The Six Sigma method is often summarised with DMAIC: Design, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control. These steps are closely aligned to Taylor's principles of scientific management, and Six Sigma is a form of Taylorism, enhanced with customer focus advocated by Deming and an understanding of psychology. Remnants of Taylorism can also be found in call centres. Operators are closely monitored, and their work is modelled using mathematical formulae, such as the Erlang-C equation. There is also a strict division of labour as in most call centres; operators are provided with detailed scripts, eliminating human spontaneity which is considered prone to error, from the interaction between customers and operators. The result of this is that call centres suffer from enormous rates of staff dissatisfaction and turnover and that some are calling for a more psychological approach.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The end of the nineteenth century was a pivotal period in the history of Western culture. Fast developments since the industrial revolution had caused social turmoil, but also increased a sense of individualism, flowing on from the ideals of the enlightenment, proclaimed by Kant and others. Taylor, however, clung to the old values of the <em>Ancien R<e9>gime</em> and implemented a strict division of labour. Taylor can be called a fundamentalist as he had an unshakable belief that his method was the only right way. Historical forces were, however, much stronger than Taylor. Subsequent management theories proclaimed a more subtle psychological approach to motivate staff, acknowledging the employees are free-thinking individuals. Although Taylor recognised that <93>some special incentive<94> was required to motivate labourers, [note]Taylor, 1911[/note] he failed to seek ways to internally motivate them because he limited himself to the methods of the exact sciences. It is for these reasons that Taylor's work has only very limited applicability in a contemporary management setting."

The importance of self-knowledge for managers and everybody else has been acknowledged through the ages and across cultures. A visitor to the temple of Apollo at Delphi in ancient Greece was commanded to <93>Know Thyself<94>, and Chinese philosopher Lao wrote that <93>self-knowledge is enlightenment<94>.[note]Pausanias. (1995). <em>Descriptions of Greece I</em>. In W. H. S. Jones (Ed.), Loeb Classical Library (Vol. 93); Lao Tzu. (1963). <em>Tao te Ching</em> (D. Lau, Ed.). London: Penguin Books.[/note] Thousands of years later, the search for the real self is still central to the human experience. Contemporary management thinkers also recognise the importance of self-knowledge and have linked it to improved management performance and subsequently the success of the organisation.[note]Bourner, T.

(1993). `Building Managers from the Inside Out<92><92> - Developing managers through competency-based action learning. <i>Journal of Management Development</i>, <i>12</i>(1), 43<96>48.[/note]

Self-knowledge is different from knowledge of the objective world.[note]Gertler, B. (2003) Self-knowledge. In E. N. Zalta (Ed.), The Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy. Available at <a title=""Stanford Encyclopedia of Magic"" href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge/"">plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge</a>, downloaded 18 May 2008.[/note] It is, by definition, subjective and is thus not easily obtained, as illustrated by the epigraph. Sigmund Freud and Carl Rogers, two of the most influential psychotherapists of the last century, theorised that people have a <a href=""https://prevos.net/humanities/psychology/personalities/"" rel=""noopener"">hidden personality</a> of which they are not aware. It is this unknown, subconscious, nature of personality that creates epistemological hurdles and makes self-knowledge a hidden treasure.

<h2>Psychometric Testing</h2>

The holy grail of human resource management is to find the perfect staff member. Countless books are devoted to the recruitment process and predicting performance based on interviews, r<e9>sum<e9>s, reference checks and psychometric testing. At Lucid Manager we have written several articles about the machinations of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tag/recruitment/"">recruitment</a>.

The main problem with this approach is that the balance of power is presumed to be on the recruiter's side. This unbalanced relationship forces the applicant to be like a dancing monkey, performing the tricks that he or she believes will please the recruiters. The applicant is often left to second-guessing the 'right' answer to the questions. And although we are often told that there are no right or wrong answers, this is of course not correct. Some answers get you the job and the ones that don't. The recruitment process is a case of double deception, both the recruiter and the applicant are not willing to have a genuine conversation because they are limited by the script of the traditional job interview.

Many different types of psychometric tests have been developed to determine a subject's personality or other aspects of the self. It seems that self-knowledge for managers is only a few tickboxes away. These tests are used in clinical settings and research but are also widely used for <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">recruitment</a> and leadership development.[note]Michael, J. (2003). Using the Myers-Briggs type indicator as a tool for leadership development? Apply with caution. <em>Journal of Leadership and Organizational Studies</em> 10 (1), 68-81.[/note]

For my <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/half-hour-mba/"">MBA studies</a>, I was asked to undertake a battery of personality and motivation tests in an attempt to improve my self-knowledge. The central question to be answered is whether this myriad of numbers and classifications describe me as a person and whether they can provide deeper self-knowledge to enable me to be a better manager.

Numerous studies have shown that psychometric tests can be used to make predictions about the behaviour of individuals and job performance. There are, however, many situational variables, such as organisational culture, which influence behaviour. Research indicates that personality plays the most significant role in situations where there are no social clues on how to behave.[note]Gray, P. (2002). <em>Psychology</em> (4th ed.). New York: Worth Publishers; Robbins, S. P., &amp; Judge, T. A. (2007).<em>Organizational behaviour</em> (12th ed.). New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall.[/note]

Some of the often used methodologies are scientifically problematic. There is little empirical evidence to confirm the validity of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbti"">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>. Also for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X"">Theory X/Y</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Alderfer"">ERG Theory</a>, there is little or no evidence to verify the validity of their assumptions.[note]Lorr M. (1991) An empirical evaluation of the MBTI typology. <em>Personality and Individual Differences</em>, 11 (12), 1141-1145; Michael (2003); Robbins &amp; Judge (2007).[/note]

A problematic aspect of self-administered psychometric testing is a high level of inherent confirmation bias, also known as the `<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect"">Forer Effect</a>'.[note]Forer, B. R. (1949). The fallacy of personal validation: A classroom demonstration of gullibility. <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em>, 44 (1), 118-123.[/note] Am I very conscientious, or do I perceive myself to be conscientious? Am I an extroverted person, or is it my high level of energy which subjugates any innate introverted personality? Do the results of these tests provide a picture of my inner self, or are they a reflection of my perceived self?

The test results do not reveal any information beyond what has been entered by me, because the results are only a linguistic rearrangement of the answers. This idea is confirmed by recent research that showed that most people could guess the outcome of personality tests without actually undertaking them.[note]Furnham, A., &amp; Dissou, G. (2007). The relationship between self-estimated and test-derived scores of personality and intelligence. <em>Journal of Individual Differences </em>28 (1), 37-44.[/note]

<h2>Self-Knowledge for Managers</h2>

Comprehensive self-knowledge can thus not be obtained by completing surveys because they can only reveal the perceived self and are not capable of unearthing the inner (subconscious) self. Psychometric tests are suitable only as a vehicle for introspection, providing an entry point for reflecting on one's self. This introspection can, however, not occur without life experience to reflect on.

Obtaining self-knowledge, considered essential for leadership development, requires something more profound and more substantial, as alluded to by Nietzsche in the epigraph to this blog entry. As situational variables predominately control our behaviour, the only way to obtain self-knowledge is life-experience.

Only by being exposed to a multitude of situations and challenges can we know what our personality is. As we gain life experience, our inner and perceived selves slowly converge. Maturity is the situation where the inner self and the perceived self are almost identical, and self-knowledge becomes apparent. Even the most carefully designed personality test can not leapfrog the knowledge obtained through life experience. Carl Gustav Jung, who inspired the development of the MBTI recognised this when he wrote:[note]Jung, C. (1999). <em>Two essays on analytical psychology</em> (2nd ed.). London: Routledge.[/note]

<blockquote>Anyone who wants to know the human psyche<a0><85> would be better advised to abandon exact science <85> and wander with human heart through the world.</blockquote>

This foray into psychometric testing leaves me to conclude that no psychometric test can ever replace the fullness of life experience to obtain true self-knowledge. Experiences such as exposing oneself to challenging situations, occasionally exploring the boundaries of morality, experiencing different cultures or going through emotional turmoil are the only meaningful ways to gain self-knowledge.

Whereas it used to take months to travel from Australia to Europe, the trip can now be undertaken in within a day, and electronic communication enables people to deliver messages across the world instantly. These changes in the spatial and temporal contours of existence have reduced the significance of space and created a globalised world.[note]Scheuerman, W. (2008) 'Globalization'.

<h2>Globalisation</h2>

Theodore Levitt introduced the term globalisation to management discourse.[note]Levitt, T. (1983) 'The globalisation of markets'. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 61(3): 92<96>102.[/note] His central thesis is that a dominant force drives the world towards a <em>converging commonality, a</em>llowing international businesses to become global by standardising their product and service offering. Convergence of consumer needs and wants is caused a proletarianisation of communication, transport of goods and travel increased wealth and greater technological efficiency enables more people to enjoy cosmopolitan benefits, previously reserved for the upper classes.

Levitt wrote his thesis during the height of the Cold War, a time when the world was divided, and people wished for a more unified globe. Levitt proclaimed a world where differences are disappearing and that no one is exempt and nothing can stop the process.[note]Levitt, 1983.[/note] His eschatological belief in a monocultural end-state for the whole of the globe gained prominence when the Iron Curtain was demolished, and hopes for a unified world abounded. American philosopher Francis Fukuyama even famously proclaimed that the end of history itself was nigh, with the world converging towards liberal democracy.[note]Fukoyama, F. (1992) <em>The End of History and the Last Man.</em> New York: The Free Press.[/note]

The relationship between converging commonality and technology can be explained when looking at culture from a symbolic interactionist perspective where culture is defined as a system of shared meanings, attitudes and values and the symbolic forms in which they are expressed.[note]te Boekhorst, P., Burke, P. and Nijhof, W. (1992) <em>Cultuur en Maatschappij in Nederland 1500<96>1850 </em>(Culture and society in the Netherlands 1500-1850). Heerlen and Meppel: Open Universiteit.[/note] The symbols of culture are transmitted through communication and with low threshold global communication, local cultural expressions have a global reach. It is this mechanism that Levitt believed to cause the inevitable convergence of all cultures.

The importance of convergence to business is partly related to the role material objects play in culture. Objects are important symbols that express underlying values. Following Goffman<92>s<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-management/""> theatrical metaphor</a>, people require objects as props for the social roles they play. People in positions of power, for example, communicate through clothing and hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.[note]Goffman, E. (1959) <em>The presentation of self in everyday life.</em> London: Penguin.[/note]<a0>Through international travel and worldwide communication, the image of the company executive has been standardised, and the three-piece suite has become the world standard for people in influential positions. This is no more apparent when observing a meeting of the United Nations, a multicultural organisation, where almost everybody wears the same type of outfit, instead of clothing traditional to their respective cultures.

On the other hand, increased global communication has also created a greater diversity in the marketplace. Consumers<a0>are becoming more sophisticated because of the expanded scope of communication, requiring a flexible and responsive strategy, instead of standardisation.[note]Stonehouse, G. et al. (2004) <em>Global and Transnational Business</em>. 2nd ed. Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons.[/note] The existence of converging commonalities in certain markets does, however, not imply that cultures themselves are converging. One object can perform simultaneous forms of social work and communicate different values in different contexts.

The iPod is an example of a fully standardised product that is sold in the same configuration all over the world. The music people listen to is, however, different in every culture. An Australian music connoisseur might enjoy the music of Nick Cave, while their Indian counterparts might prefer Bollywood products and in Arab countries, Quran readings are more popular. The market for electronic music players is, from a marketing perspective, entirely homogeneous, but the underlying cultural values are heterogeneous. Some research even suggests that countries are diverging rather than converging and that, despite recent developments in communication and travel technology, physical proximity remains an essential factor in the similarities between cultures.[note]Craig, C. S., Douglas, S. P. and Grein, A. (1992) 'Patterns of convergence and divergence among industrialised nations: 1960<96>1988'. <em>Journal of International Business Studies</em> 23(4): 773<96>787.[/note]

<h2>Converging Commonality</h2>

Convergence can, according to Levitt, only occur when corporations ask people what they want out of life, rather than what product or service specifications they prefer. This is in line with Levitt<92>s seminal paper in which he coined the term <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-myopia/"">Marketing Myopia</a> for those organisations that define their product or service offering too thinly.[note]Levitt, T. (1960) <91>Marketing myopia<92>. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 38(4): 45<96>56.[/note] What people want out of life is largely determined by psychology, which is largely independent of culture. The common goals cited by Levitt are alleviation of life<92>s burdens and the expansion of discretionary time and spending power.[note]Levitt, 1983.[/note]

Levitt<92>s thesis of converging commonality can be criticised for simplifying the complexity of international business. Although there are indeed similar needs between people, as suggested by <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-value-proposition/"">Abraham Maslow</a>, cultural characteristics determine the way people seek to satisfy these.[note]Maslow, A. (1943) 'A theory of human motivation'. <em>Psychological Review</em> 50: 370<96>396.[/note]

The need for international expansion of business activities was recognised in the nineteenth century by Marx and Engels, who argued that the imperatives of capitalism drive corporations to <93>settle everywhere, and establish connections everywhere<94>, paving the way for a universal interdependence of nations, instead of local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency.[note]Marx, K. and Engels, F. (1990) <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party.</em> Beijing: Foreign Language Press.[/note]

In more recent scholarship, George Yip identified four specific categories of drivers for globalisation, i.e. market, cost, government and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-management-and-business-performance/"">competitive drivers</a>.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note] Market drivers relate directly to Levitt<92>s thesis of converging commonality and the creation of global needs. The cost structure of the product or service offering can also drive globalisation in that industries with a high fixed cost, such as car manufacturing, tend to be global to increase the market and potential sales volume. Government drivers relate to trade policies, and technical standards and competitive globalisation drivers are created by the existence of global competitors in a given market.

Businesses employing a global strategy generally operate in markets with low pressures for local responsiveness and high pressures to minimise cost. The low pressure for local responsiveness allows for large economies of scale because one standard product can be offered to a large global market. The large size of a global market also gives greater bargaining power to buyers, which puts downward pressure on prices and thus cost leadership is an important aspect of an organisation seeking a global strategy.[note]Hill, W., Jones, G. R. and Galvin, P. (2004) <em>Strategic management: An integrated approach.</em> Milton: Wiley.[/note] However, as argued above, there are only a few markets where there is no need for local responsiveness and customisation.

If the thesis of converging commonality is correct, then this would remove the need for market segmentation, and product positioning strategies and standardised products could be sold worldwide.[note]Stonehouse et al. 2004.[/note] But, as there are significant differences between cultures, as illustrated by the model proposed by Geert Hofstede,[note]Hofstede, G. (1983) 'National cultures in four dimensions: A research-based theory of cultural differences among nations'. <em>International Studies of Management and Organizations </em>XIII(1): 46<96>74.[/note]<a0>the convergence hypothesis is not true. Levitt does, however, not argue that global companies only offer a single product to a single market. Segmentation is a central marketing strategy in a global economy, but the segments themselves are transnational. A particular segment in one country will have close cousins elsewhere in the world.[note]Levitt, 1983.[/note] Global companies need to make distinctions and adjustments in different markets. McDonald<92>s is a company that employs an international strategy that incorporates local responsiveness, offering the same core products worldwide, but with adjustments to the menu reflecting local tastes.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note]

The tension between the desire to deliver standardised products to achieve economies of scale the need for local responsiveness to meet consumer needs adds a layer of complexity to corporate strategy. Levitt<92>s view that the focus of a global strategy should be on standardisation of products and marketing does not reflect these complexities and ignores the cultural diversity that shapes consumer needs. The extent to which an industry is global can be determined using the globalisation drivers identified by Yip.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note] The globalisation drivers can be related to Michael Porter<92>s framework for industry analysis.[note]Porter, M. (1979) 'How competitive forces shape strategy'. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 57(2): 137<96>145.[/note]

Convergence of consumer needs and wants reduces opportunities for differentiation and thus increase the threat of entry by new competitors. Global marketing and creating brand equity is a means by which the risk of new entries can be reduced.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note] This is illustrated by the domination of Apple in the digital music player market. Although there are sufficient alternatives of similar quality, Apple can maintain their market lead through their brand equity. The economies of scale required to be successful in a global market reduce the threat, as any new entrant will need substantial investments and time to reach the same point on the experience curve as existing companies. The threat of substitutes is increased by global businesses that invest heavily in research and development.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note]

The market of consumer electronics, with high development cost and short product life cycle, is an example where the threat of substitutes is always very high and thus Apple needs to improve their music players to sustain their position as market leader. The large size of a global market increases the bargaining power of buyers, which is counteracted by the reduced bargaining power of suppliers.[note]Stonehouse et al., 2004.[/note] In a globalised market and industry, competitive rivalry is very high as it is difficult to differentiate. Operating in a larger market also increases the number of business to compete with.

Recent advances in communication and transportation technology have increased the level of interconnectedness across cultures. Cultural expressions have a global reach, which has converged the needs and wants of consumers in certain aspects.

The convergence of consumer needs is, however, only skin deep<a0>as the cultural values that drive the use of products and services on offer in the global market remains heterogeneous. Although Levitt<92>s thesis of converging commonality can be criticised for simplifying the complexity of international business, the drive to large economies of scale motivates international corporations to seek truly global strategies."
76,essence-of-entrepreneurship,Searching for the Essence of Entrepreneurship <97> A Misguided Quest,"Public figures such as Henry Ford, Richard Branson, Dick Smith and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/trumpworld-analysis/"">Donald Trump</a> influence the conventional notion of the entrepreneur as a unique individual. Entrepreneurs have achieved celebrity status and have given rise to many myths about entrepreneurship.

One of these myths is the idea that entrepreneurship is an innate ability that can not be acquired and that business instinct is more important than business skill.[note]Wellington, D. C. and Zandvakili, S. (2006) 'The entrepreneurial myth, globalisation and American economic dominance'.<em> International Journal of Social Economics</em> 33(9): 615.[/note]

Because of their prominent status in society, entrepreneurs have become the heroes of contemporary society, admired as heroes for their ability to accumulate wealth and create economic prosperity.[note]Whelan, G. and O'Gorman, C. (2007) 'The Schumpeterian and universal hero myth in stories of Irish entrepreneurs'. <em>Irish Journal of Management</em> 28(2): 79<96>107.[/note]

<h2>Entrepreneurs are the heroes of society</h2>

Academic discourse about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/becoming-an-entrepreneur/"">entrepreneurship</a> is divided and sometimes even confusing.[note]de Goey, F. (1996) 'Ondernemersgeschiedenis in Amerika, Nederland en Belgi<eb>'. [Entrepreneural history in the Netherlands, America and Belgium]. In <em>Jaarboek voor economische, bedrijfs- en techniekgeschiedenis</em>. NEHA; Pech, R., ed. (2009) <em>Entrepreneurial courage, audacity, genius</em>. Sydney: Pearson Education; Steyaert, C. (1998) 'A qualitative methodology for process studies of entrepreneurship'. <em>International Studies of Management &amp; Organisation</em> 27(3): 13<96>33; Wellington and Zandvakili, 2006.[/note]

Are entrepreneurs guided by a Protestant ethic, as proclaimed by Max Weber or are they, following Schumpeter, unique individuals exercising mental freedom? Do entrepreneurs have a high need to achieve (<em>n-Ach</em>), following McClelland's theory of motivation, or are they, as argued by de Vries, victims of a traumatic childhood?[note]de Goey, 1996.[/note] Who are these heroes of contemporary capitalism?

In this essay, entrepreneurs from four continents are discussed and contrasted, guided by the literature on entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs from different continents are chosen to provide a cross-cultural perspective on the phenomenon. Freddy Heineken is included because of his controversial place in Dutch society. Michael Dell is often touted as the quintessential entrepreneur. Australian Peter Terret provides a contrast to Heineken and Dell because of the modest size of his venture. Lastly, Vietnamese entrepreneur Le Khac Hiep represents a non-Western perspective.

The available information about these people is used to deconstruct the mythology of the entrepreneur, in search of the essence of entrepreneurship. The essay finds that the essentialist approach to entrepreneurial studies can only provide limited insight and that narrative analysis of entrepreneurial biographies should be the preferred method to study this phenomenon. The managerial impact of this conclusion is that the most effective way to become more entrepreneurial is to explore the biographies of successful entrepreneurs.

<h2>Biographies of Entrepreneurs</h2>

<h3>Freddy Heineken</h3>

Freddy (Alfred) Heineken (1923<96>2002) is one of the most well known Dutch entrepreneurs of the twentieth century. He joined the <a href=""http://www.heineken.nl/"">Heineken</a> brewery in Amsterdam during the Second World War, which was founded in 1863 by his grandfather. After the war, Freddy worked several years in the sales department of Heineken's American importer, where he developed his marketing skills. Some years later, Freddy decided to buy the majority of shares, creating the starting point of more than four decades of successful entrepreneurship. Under his leadership, which ended in 1989, Heineken grew to become one of the major breweries in the world and one of the most recognisable beer brands. In the Netherlands, Freddy Heineken was a celebrity entrepreneur, especially after his kidnapping and subsequent release in 1983.[note]Heineken (2005) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_International#History"">The history of Heineken</a>; Smit, B. (1996) Heineken. <em>Een Leven in de Brouwerij [A life in the brewery]</em>. Nijmegen: SUN.[/note]

Shortly after his death, several facts about Heineken's activities outside his business have been revealed[note]Zwaap, R. (2002) 'De Schaduwkoning van Nederland' [The shadow-king of the Netherlands]. <em>De Groene Amsterdammer</em>.[/note], Providing an insight into his personality and motivational drives. These revelations show him to be an influential power broker in Dutch politics, using his marketing skills to assist political friends in the liberal party (VVD). These aspects of his biography reveal him to be a strong Machiavellian type, which was most likely a personality trait that assisted him in growing the business. The Machiavellian personality type is generally considered to be pragmatic, emotionally distanced and prioritising the goals over the means.[note]Robbins, S. P. and Judge, T. A. (2007)<em> Organizational Behavior</em>. 12th ed. New Jersey: Pearson Prentice Hall.[/note]

<blockquote>I don't sell beer, I sell good times.</blockquote>

Above all, the entrepreneurial essence of Freddy Heineken is that he was a gifted marketer. He is reputed to have said: <93>I don't sell beer, I sell good times<94>,[note]Dutch original: <93>Ik verkoop geen bier, ik verkoop gezelligheid<94>[/note] illustrating that Heineken did not suffer from Marketing Myopia, as defined by Levitt.[note]Levitt, T. (1960) 'Marketing Myopia'. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 38(4): 45<96>56.[/note] He understood the need to focus on the perceived benefits of his product, rather than marketing the product itself. This vision enabled him to position Heineken beer and differentiate it from other brands. Heineken used his marketing skills as a vehicle for his high need for achievement and drive to accumulate power. It is the combination of his strong personality and his marketing skills that made him the successful entrepreneur he became to be.

<h3>Michael Dell</h3>

Michael Dell was interested in technology from a young age and started to sell computers while still attending university. Selling computers was not something new in 1984, but Dell sold computers directly to consumers, bypassing traditional distribution channels.

This strategy allowed him to minimise distribution costs and thus generate above-average profits. He decided to quit university and corporatise his business, which has since then grown into one of the largest computer manufacturers in the world[note]Burke, S. (2003) 'Michael Dell'. <em>CRN</em> 1075: 30;35.[/note]. His dissatisfaction with existing computer suppliers enabled him to recognise an opportunity in this market.[note]Burke, 2003.[/note]

The success of his business is also founded on an understanding of consumer needs. Dell regularly reads Usenet forums, chat rooms and Web sites to find out what customers think about his products: <93>I learn about things we are doing well. I learn when we screw up<94>.[note]Fishman, C. (2001) <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/44/dell.html"">Facetime with Michael Dell</a>. Fast Company (44).[/note]

<a title=""mikeandryan [CC BY 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons"" href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_Dell_2010.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Michael_Dell_2010.jpg"" alt=""Michael Dell 2010"" width=""256"" /></a>
Michael is reluctant to provide information about his private life,[note]Fishman, 2001[/note] making it difficult to tap into the psychology of this entrepreneur. Dell, who used to compete in triathlons, is described by Ralph Szygenda, CIO of General Motors, as a <93>violent competitor who doesn't like to lose<94>,[note]Burke, 2003, 35.[/note] illustrating Dell's competitive drive. According to a long time friend, Michael Dell is very determined and has <93>never deviated from his early business vision and almost enjoyed being doubted by others<94>,[note]Burke, 2003, p. 35.[/note] Illustrating his high need for achievement.

Michael Dell's entrepreneurial essence could be his insight in supply chain management and customer focus, revolutionising marketing logistics, not only in the computer industry but across industries,[note]Burke, 2003.[/note] Dell has continued to innovate their supply chain, being one of the first businesses (in 1996) to utilise the Internet to market computers directly to consumers.[note]Fishman, 2001.[/note]

<h3>Peter Terret</h3>

Australian entrepreneur Peter Terret has a background in geodetic and topographic survey and developed an interest in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in 1986. He is the Managing Director of <a href=""http://www.rapidmap.com.au/"">RapidMap</a>, a medium-sized company established in 1994, that specialises in geospatial equipment and services. RapidMap has since grown into an international provider delivering geospatial products and services.[note]Pech, 2009[/note]

Compared to the previously discussed entrepreneurial heavyweights Heineken and Dell, RapidMap is a modest business. Although RapidMap is a global player in the geospatial services market, compared to Heineken and Dell, it is a small business. The entrepreneurial principles that determine the destiny of all businesses are, however, independent of size.

Just like Dell, Terret has been able to recognise an imperfection in the market. While Dell developed a marketing strategy, based on his dissatisfaction with the computer market, Terret's insight was that he tapped into the need for some organisations, such as water corporations, to manage various physical assets over a large geographical area. Their ability to recognise opportunity is based on knowledge of the markets in which they operate and being able to think from the consumer's perspective. Parallel with Heineken, Terret based the success of his venture also on his marketing skills. By augmenting his product with the field-kit, RapidMap was able to differentiate itself from the competition, enabling Terret to capture the emerging market for mobile GPS solutions.

<h3>Le Khac Hiep</h3>

Le Khac Hiep is one of the many entrepreneurs that benefit from <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/human-resource-management-in-hanoi/"">Vietnam's <em>Doi Moi</em></a> (restoration) policy and transition from a centrally controlled economy to a market economy. He is the chairman of <a href=""http://www.vingroup.net/"">VinCom Joint Stock Company</a>, specialising in property development. VinCom has two major holdings: VinCom City Towers in Hanoi and the Sofitel VinPearl Resort and Spa in Hha Trang province.

Compared to Michael Dell and Terret, Hiep was not the <em>primum movens</em> of VinCom, but just like Heineken, hired by the company. This contrary to the common notion of the entrepreneur as the person starting a venture, which shows that the fortunes of an organisation can be turned by hiring people with an entrepreneurial mindset.

Le Khac Hiep states that one of the most important aspects of his achievement is a <93>hunger for success and aggressiveness and <85> the desire to do something meaningful for family friends and people<94>.[note]Pech, 2009, p. 160.[/note] Suzanne Young, who interviewed Hiep, portrays him as a person with <93>graciousness and modesty with a respectful disposition and hunger for achievement<94>.[note]Pech, 2009, p. 163, emphasis added.[/note] He shares a high desire for achievement with Heineken and Dell, but Hiep's definition of success is grounded in family, friends and people in general. In a Western cultural context, achievement is usually directed at personal success.

<h3>Discussion</h3>

Two common themes can be extracted from the case studies. All four described entrepreneurs show a high need for achievement (<em>n-Ach</em>) as defined by McClelland.[note]McCelland, D. C. (1976) <em>The achieving society</em>. New York: Irving Publishers.[/note] The direction of the need to achieve is determined by culture, biography and personality.

Le Khac Hiep illustrates this link with culture. His need to achieve is more focused at the collective, rather than his personal achievement, illustrating the individualism-collectivism spectrum identified by Hofstede.[note]Hofstede, G. (1993) <em>Allemaal Andersdenkenden (Cultures and Organisations: Software of the Mind)</em>. Amsterdam: Contact.[/note] South-East Asian cultures, such as Vietnam, are classified as collectivist cultures, while the Netherlands, Australia and the USA are classified as individualistic.

<h2>The Philosopher's Stone of entrepreneurialism</h2>

Characteristic of entrepreneurs described in business literature is that their need for achievement is expressed through commercial activities. A need for achievement can, however, also be internally directed, such as is the case with most artists, or the need to achieve can be aimed at changing the behaviour of others, such as is the case with, for example, political activists.

Although artists, activists and other people also exhibit entrepreneurial behaviour, the extant literature on entrepreneurs focuses on business ventures, with the aim the extract the Philosopher's Stone of entrepreneurialism so that others can duplicate their achievements. A high need to achieve is a <em>sine qua non</em> for any entrepreneur. It is a necessary condition that to be entrepreneurial one needs a high drive to succeed.

Findings from McClelland, who demonstrated a link between the need to achieve and economic growth, support this idea. It is, however, not a sufficient condition to become more entrepreneurial. Other personal attributes, i.e. abilities, attitudes, skills and knowledge are also important determinants of an entrepreneurial mindset.[note]Pech, 2009.[/note]

The second aspect is the relationship between learnt skills and innate abilities of the entrepreneur. Michael Dell seems to have a natural ability to recognise opportunity and has developed his marketing skills in the process. Freddy Heineken also obtained his marketing skills on the job, while expatriated to the United States. The available data does not indicate whether Peter Terret and Le Khac Hiep have formal qualifications in management.

However, from this, it can not be concluded that entrepreneurs by definition have an innate ability to recognise marketing opportunities rather than being skilled in marketing techniques. First of all, the selected sample is too small to draw a general conclusion. Secondly, the available biographies are incomplete and could hide any formal education undertaken by these entrepreneurs.

<h2>Synthesis</h2>

The four entrepreneurs discussed in this overview illustrate that entrepreneurship is not an isolated Western cultural phenomenon. All four entrepreneurs show a high need for achievement and an (innate) ability to spot opportunities in the market. The culture-independent nature of entrepreneurial behaviour is confirmed by numerous ethnographic studies of, for example, the Ibos in Nigeria or the in Columbia.[note]de Goey, (1996).[/note] But, does the fact that entrepreneurship is a culture-independent phenomenon support the conclusion that there is an essence of entrepreneurship?

Entrepreneurial narratives offer a wide range of characteristics that entrepreneurs are considered to be imbued with. Cunningham and Lischeron identified several schools of thought in entrepreneurship studies.[note]Cunningham, J. B. and Lischeron, J. (1991) 'Defining entrepreneurship'. <em>Journal of Small Business Management </em>29(1): 45<96>61.[/note] The Great Person school assumes that entrepreneurs have an innate intuition and ability to be entrepreneurs. The Psychological Characteristics school focuses on personality traits as enablers of entrepreneurial success.

The Classical School follows the Schumpeterian idea of the entrepreneur as an innovator. The more pragmatic Management School sees entrepreneurs as organisers of economic ventures, trained in the necessary technical skills.

Lastly, the Leadership school focuses on the ability of entrepreneurs to motivate people.[note]Cunningham and Lischeron, 1991.[/note] All schools of thought have in common that they are essentialist, endeavouring to define those aspects of entrepreneurial behaviour that are characteristic to all entrepreneurs.

Cunningham and Lischeron argue that the current variety of schools of thought is because the academic study of entrepreneurs is a young field of endeavour and propose a pragmatic approach that uses insights from all schools of thought, depending on the stage of development the business is in. This call for paradigmatic pluralism reflects the complex nature of entrepreneurialism, but it also shows a deeper problem in entrepreneurial studies.

Defining dynamic phenomena such as entrepreneurship from an essentialist perspective is an impossible task because the complexity of social reality continuously presents new aspects that do not fit into a previously considered complete definition. No list of characteristics associated with entrepreneurship can ever be considered a sufficient condition for a particular person to become an entrepreneur.

Some characteristics, such as <em>n-</em>Achievement, can be considered a necessary condition for entrepreneurship to arise. Environmental obstacles and opportunity factors, such as community acceptance social shifts and resource availability, interact with personal attributes and it is the convergence of the two that enable successful business ventures.[note]Pech, 2009.[/note] Given the unpredictable nature of environmental obstacles and opportunity factors, prospects of establishing a causal model of successful entrepreneurship are minimal.

<h2>The myth of the entrepreneur</h2>

Entrepreneurial narratives portray the entrepreneur as the hero of contemporary capitalism. This view, influenced by the early work of Schumpeter which emphasises the achievements of the individual, shows many parallels with the role of the hero in mythology. In mythology, a hero is a person from a humble background who needs to leave the group in search of adventure. The hero overcomes adversity and temporary failures but eventually succeeds in achieving his or her goals. Whelan and O'Gorman demonstrated that the typical entrepreneurial biography has many parallels with traditional hero mythology. The entrepreneur is mythological, not in the sense of myth as a fake story, but as an archetypal person in contemporary society.

Following the hero theme, the label 'entrepreneurial' is mostly associated with people who are successful,[note]Legge, J. and Hindle, K. (1997) <em>Entrepreneurship: How Innovators Create the Future.</em> South Melbourne: MacMillan.; Pech, 2009.[/note] Excluding those that did not succeed. This value-laden use of the category entrepreneurial directs all research effort into those that were successful.[note]Seymour, R. G. (2006) 'Hermeneutic phenomenology and international entrepreneurship research'. <em>Journal of International Entrepreneurship</em> 4: 137<96>155.[/note]

This approach is analogous with a palaeontologist who only studies species that have survived evolutionary pressures, ignoring those that are extinct. Using this method creates a sanitised and incomplete picture of the entrepreneurial phenomena.

French anthropologist Bruno Latour investigated the process of science creation and found that the results of scientific work are an idealised version of the actual process[note]Widdershoven-Heerding, C., ed. (1995) <em>Wetenschapsleer [Philosophy of Science]</em>. Open Universiteit.[/note]. This process is also active in entrepreneurial studies.

Entrepreneurial biographies are always incomplete and sanitised versions of reality. Entrepreneurs that are researched project their self-image on the information they provide about themselves which can lead to subconscious repression of the role of serendipity or even actively censoring of biographies. Researchers are forced to condense the ambiguity of entrepreneurial reality into the concepts described in research. One such condensed aspect of entrepreneurialism is the focus on individual achievements, mainly ignoring the influence that spouses, colleagues, suppliers and others have on the entrepreneur. This focus on the individual matches the mythological hero aspects of entrepreneurialism and is contrary to the emphasis on teamwork in contemporary business discourse.[note]Whelan and O'Gorman, 2007.[/note]

In light of the paradigmatic confusion and problematic aspects of essentialism, some researchers have called for and experimented with alternative methods to research entrepreneurs.[note]Jennings, P. L., Perren, L. and Carter, S. (2005) 'Alternative perspectives on entrepreneurship research'. <em>Entrepreneurship theory and practice</em> 29(2): 145<96>152.; Seymour, 2006; Steyaert, 1998[/note] They propose to use interpretive methods to study entrepreneurs. The scholar of entrepreneurship should engage the available information and uncover gender, class and other aspects, looking from a prosopographical perspective that includes the network of people around the entrepreneur. This aspect will lead to a deep <em>Verstehen</em> of entrepreneurial behaviour instead of a catalogue of characteristics and models.

<h2>There is no essence of entrepreneurship</h2>

The search for the essence of entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour is guided by the desire to be able to duplicate the successes of the studied subjects. It is thought that assuming the essence of entrepreneurship can be found; this knowledge can help others to achieve the same.

The paradigmatic confusion in entrepreneurial studies illustrates, however, that there is no essence of entrepreneurship. The absence of essence is supported by current thinking in the philosophy of science. This idea does not imply that entrepreneurship cannot be successfully studied to assist others in becoming more entrepreneurial.

The most meaningful way to learn how to become more entrepreneurial is to examine the behaviour of entrepreneurs and read their biographies and interpretations of their behaviour. Universities should equip students of entrepreneurialism with skills to analyse and deconstruct narrative to gain a deep understanding of the entrepreneurs that came before them."

This situation is a type of conversation that can be heard in <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/human-resource-management-in-hanoi/"">offices around the world</a>. On what grounds do organisations hire people and when they are hired, how do they ensure that they contribute to organisational goals? That an organisation gets the employees it deserves implies a causal relationship between the actions of managers as representatives of their organisation and the performance of employees.

One of the first to research these questions in a systematic way was <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/frederick-taylor-management-fundamentalism/"">Frederick Taylor</a> (1911). Taylor himself certainly got the employees he deserved. His Spartan approach, combined with a negative view of labourers, spawned a lot of unrest and workers literally threw spanners in the works. Taylor's controversial practices even became subject to a congressional investigation. Contemporary human resource management has a more balanced view on recruitment and how people can be managed to increase the likelihood that organisational objectives are achieved. Human resource management well practised can potentially give a significant advantage over competitors (de Cieri et al. 2008: 48).

The importance of selecting and retaining suitable people is even more important in an economic recession. Brown (2008: 17) wrote in this context that:

<blockquote>it is hard to recruit and retain good staff. If [during the recession] you let them go, it could make or break a company's reputation.</blockquote>

This essay discusses the ways in which an organisation conducts recruitment, selects, motivates and retains the staff it needs, rather than the staff it deserves. The first section discusses the importance of recruitment and selection. The second section provides a cursory overview of performance management. It will be argued that organisations indeed get the employees they deserve because the extent to which employees contribute to organisational objectives is directly related to the quality of the effort invested by an organisation to recruit, select and motivate staff.

Recruitment and selection are the practices of an organisation by which it identifies and attracts people considered to be able to contribute to the achievement of the organisation's objectives. The recruitment process is aimed at communicating the existence of a vacancy to those segments of the job market that an organisation seeks to recruit from. In the selection process, appropriate mechanisms are used to choose the candidate that is most likely to contribute to the organisation's objectives (de Cieri et al. 2008).

The recruitment process is influenced by several factors. The main objective of Recruitment and Selection is to increase the likelihood of a match between applicant and vacancy characteristics, or job fit. Job fit is bidirectional as the vacancy characteristics need to fit the applicant characteristics and vice versa. Only if the fit is bidirectional will the incumbent be in the best possible position to contribute positively to the organisation. This is achieved by controlling the three influencing factors. Human resource policies affect the characteristics of the vacancy (job design). Recruitment sources determine which segment of the job market is targeted and thus influence applicant characteristics. The recruiters themselves also influence the job choice through their impact on both job design and applicant characteristics.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Human resource policies are the guiding principles that shape how an organisation wishes to undertake its human resource practices. They are the starting point of all systems, including workforce planning practices (State Services Authority 2007). The characteristics of the vacancy, such as position objectives, responsibility level and remuneration are determined in the workforce planning process.</p>

Traditionally, recruitment and selection is aimed at finding an applicant that matches the job requirements. Some organisations use a juxtaposed approach by designing a job to suit a candidate (Fox 2000). Lee (1994) and Mackinlay (1993) advocate a mutual adaptability between the organisation and the candidate to ensure the best possible job fit. From this it can be concluded that Human Resource policies need to be flexible to allow the recruiters to achieve the best outcome.

The source of recruitment influences applicant characteristics because each source istargeted towards a certain segment of the job market. Research by Breaugh (1981: 145) showed that the source of recruitment is strongly related to subsequent job performance, absenteeism and work attitudes. Breaugh (1981: 145) showed that people placed through universities and to a lesser extent those sourced through newspapers, were inferior in performance to applicants who were sourced through advertisements in professional publications. People recruited through newspaper advertisement missed almost twice as many days as those recruited through other sources, such as employee referrals (Breaugh 1981).However, Wooden and Harding (1998) reported that the most popular and most successful recruitment source in Australian private industry, as measured by the number of filled vacancies, are newspaper advertisements. One possible explanation of this phenomenon is the Individual Difference Hypothesis in which it is stated that recruitment sources differ in the types (education, class, self-image and so on) of applicants they reach, which will result in different outcomes. Following this hypothesis, people recruited through employee referrals may be more capable than individuals recruited from public sources because current employees will screen potential applicants before they consider them for a position in the organisation as their own reputation is at stake (Breaugh and Starke 2000).

Recent research has shown that managers in Hanoi prefer informal networks, such as family members of existing staff, as a source of recruitment (Watson and Prevos 2009). Vietnamese managers perceive hiring from the extended network of staff to achieve better organisational commitment. The effectiveness of informal networks as a prime recruitment source is evidenced by the original research by Breaugh (1981) and would seem to support the Individual Difference Hypothesis. Recruiters influence vacancy characteristics because they are often involved in the design of the jobs to be recruited. The psychological traits of a recruiter also influence applicant characteristics. De Cieri et al (2008) identify warmth and informativeness as important aspects. In general, applicants respond more positively to recruiters with these traits. It is a recruiter's task to provide an atmosphere in which applicants are able to fully explore their suitability. Many people are nervous in an interview situation and the recruiter sometimes needs to help the applicant by ensuring the requirements of the position are clearly communicated.

The recruiter also passively influences applicant characteristics because they interpret information provided by the applicant and determine to what extent they match the vacancy requirements. From a philosophical perspective, the recruitment process involves a hermeneutic in which the applicant and the recruiter need to interpret each other's expectations by processing the information provided. The fact that the recruitment process is undertaken in a power imbalance (Heap 2008) adds an additional layer of complexity because both parties are rarely prepared to be fully open to each other, which requires special communication and interpretation skills of the recruiter.

Many selection methods such as interviews, psychometric testing, physical ability tests and situational exercises, are at the disposal of recruiters. There are five main issues to be considered regarding these methods (de Cieri et al. 2008). The measures used to determine the best candidate need to be consistent and reliable and as much as possible free from random error. Secondly, the outcomes need to be generalisable and free from contextual influences. The usefulness or utility of the selection process is the third important point. Penultimately, any method used during selection needs to be tested for legality, specially regarding possible discrimination of applicants. Last aspect is the validity of the selection method, which is the extent to which a measure used in selection assesses all relevant aspects of future job performance.

The validity of a selection method is determined by measuring the correlation between an applicant's test scores and their future performance on the job (de Cieri et al. 2008). Validity can, however, only be determined for quantitative methods, such as psychometric testing and physical testing. Personality inventory tests are a popular quantitative method for personnel selection. An applicant's personality inventory is considered to influence performance as research shows that successful managers share a large number of personality traits. However, the validity of personality testing has not been generally supported in research. Besides issues with validity, there are also legal impediments as a personality test can be perceived as an invasion of privacy (Scroggins et al. 2009).

In qualitative methods, the predictive validity is much harder to measure and is influenced by the characteristics of the recruiter and their ability to communicate job expectations and interpret information provided by the candidate, as discussed above.

Given the issues sketched above, no recruitment and selection process is consistently able to deliver a perfect fit between vacancy characteristics and applicant characteristics. Also, the dynamic nature of business requires people to adapt to new situations not foreseen during the recruitment and selection process. Thus, in the quest of having the best possible employees, recruitment and selection are only the first step. After new staff have been hired, ongoing performance management, which can be defined as the <93>process through which managers ensure that the activities and outputs of employees are congruent with the objectives of the organisation<94> (de Cieri et al. 2008: 343), is required. The objective of performance management is to motivate staff to consistently undertake their daily tasks with intensity, persistence and effort (Robbins and Judge 2007).

A plethora of motivation theories has been proposed over the past decades. One of the most widely accepted models is Victor Vroom's Expectancy Theory. According to Vroom, the <93>strength of a tendency to act in a certain way depends on the strength of an expectation that he act will be followed by an outcome and on the attractiveness of that outcome<94> (Robbins and Judge 2007: 208). Vroom's model uses three concepts to explain motivation.

<ol>
    <li>Expectancy: the likelihood, as perceived by the individual, that exerting a given amount of effort will lead to performance.</li>
    <li>Instrumentality: the degree to which the individual is convinced that performing at a certain level will lead to a desired outcome.</li>
    <li>Valance: the degree to which organisational rewards match an individual's personal goals.</li>
</ol>

The basic utility of Expectancy Theory is that in order to enhance performance of individuals, managers should link rewards to performance and that these rewards are deserved and wanted by employees. An employment relationship is underpinned by principles of mutuality and reciprocity (Heap 2008) in that employees expect a return for their efforts, as outlined in Expectancy Theory. A return can be provided to employees on three levels. A primary employment condition is the remuneration employees receive in return for their labour. Many systems have been developed to shape remuneration in order to motivate employees to behave in a certain manner.

However, research undertaken by Hertzberg has led him to conclude that money is a limited means of motivating staff. He classified salary as a Hygiene Factor, rather than a Motivator, which means that remuneration keeps people from being dissatisfied, but only has limited utility in motivating staff to improve performance (Robbins and Judge 2007). Secondary employment conditions, such as annual leave are also considered Hygiene Factors, specially in countries where these are considered basic entitlements. The tertiary level of employee rewards relates to those aspects of the employment relationship that are usually not controlled through a formal agreement. They can be social benefits, work conditions or more ephemeral aspects of a working relationship such as a sense of achievement or recognition. An example of a company that uses tertiary benefits to motivate and retain staff is Google. Their offices are known for their informal atmosphere, including many opportunities to relax and play games (de Cieri et al. 2008).

Providing better tools of the trade can also be a means to motivate staff and improve performance. One example is knowledge management which, besides having the ability to create a competitive advantage through the creation of intellectual property, also assist individuals to perform better because effective knowledge management systems may relieve individuals of the burden of reinventing the wheel, freeing them to engage in more creative tasks (Child and Shumate 2007: 30). Research by Child and Shumate (2007) lead them to conclude that knowledge management that is based on tacit knowledge held by individuals, rather than moving that knowledge to repositories, has a positive effect on team performance. Managers should focus on communication training, relationship building and other social knowledge management techniques. This research illustrates that opportunities to motivate staff and improve organisational performance go beyond traditional primary and secondary reward systems. Besides recruiting, selecting and managing the performance of staff, it is also imperative for organisations to minimise staff turnover. An employee leaving an organisation can cost about two times their annual salary to replace (Eaton 2003). Many professional firms record staff turnover among young professionals of around 25%. The most often cited cause for this is that the younger generations have high expectations of their career and actively seek out opportunities to improve their situation. The younger generation have a whole-of-life orientation, rather than a focus on work-life balance and for them work is just another aspect of their lives that has to match the rest of their existence (Heathcote 2004).

Many solutions have been proposed to maximise staff retention. For example, organisations offering family-friendly policies are successful at retaining employees, even if individuals did not use the policies themselves (Eaton 2003). However, <93>few scholars have demonstrated the mechanisms through which such policies function (or do not) to enhance firm performance<94> (Eaton 2003: 163). Eaton (2003) also found that control over work time, flexibility and pace of work are important determinants in creating positive levels of commitment and productivity. Other possible solutions to retain staff are talent management, including career customisation, work solutions such as changing the design of an organisation or moving into virtual workplaces; and having clear and powerful employee value propositions (Brown 2008).

In conclusion, the statement <93>management gets the employees it deserves<94> is correct as 'deserving' implies that the quality of staff is related to the quality of the effort an organisation invests in Human Rescource Management. The methods and strategies discussed in this essay show that an organisation can have active control over the employees it gets. More specifically, an organisation needs to be actively involved in developing Human Resource policies to ensure jobs are designed to maximise the likelihood of a good job fit.

Recruiting also needs to be undertaken through appropriate sources to ensure that the right segment of the job market is targeted and recruiters need to be selected and trained to ensure the best outcome in the recruitment process.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Selection methods also have an impact on the ability of an organisation to the find employees it wants. Finding the right method is problematic in light of issues with reliability and validity. Quantitative methods, such as <a title=""The Cult of Personality"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/self-knowledge-for-managers/"">personality testing</a>, can give a false sense of validity and qualitative methods suffer from hermeneutic problems. To mitigate these issues, recruiter training and experience are the most effective means to enhance the selection process.</p>

Lastly, motivational theories show that employee reward, specially beyond remuneration can have a positive effect on staff motivation and performance. Organisations need to actively seek out what type of reward works best with their staff and ensure that the benefits for high performing staff are communicated.

The economy of Vietnam is transitioning from a centrally planned to a free market system and has moved from a situation of crisis after the war against the Americans to a vibrant, fast-growing nation. The main question for this research is to provide a description of contemporary Human Resource Management in Hanoi, within the context of their transitioning economy.

This project is part of a research expedition to Hanoi, undertaken by the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/half-hour-mba/"">Graduate School of Management</a> of La Trobe University, with assistance from Hanoi University. Data was gathered through site visits to seven local businesses and government organisations and through five confidential interviews with managers of local businesses.

Vietnam has gone through enormous changes since the introduction of Doi Moi, Vietnam<92>s economic restoration policy that commenced in 1986, the government policy that seeks to transition the Vietnamese economy from a centrally-planned to a market-driven economy (Williams 1992). The process of transition in developing economies has a major impact on the way business is adopted (Warner et al. 2005) and the way Human Resource Management practices are conducted.

Several researchers have investigated management styles in Vietnamese organisations and found significant differences between Vietnamese and Western styles of management (Nguyen 2000; Quang and Vuong 2002; Rowley and Abdul-Rahman 2008). Country culture is, however, not a homogeneous phenomenon and significant differences between the work values of North and South Vietnamese management exist (Ralston et al. 1999). This report is thus focused on Human Resource Management in North Vietnam and specifically the capital Hanoi.

A literature review of Human Resource management in Vietnam shows that Vietnamese management styles in the state sector can be <93>bureaucratic, familial, conservative and authoritarian<94>, emphasising clear reporting relationships, formal communication and strict control (Quang and Vuong 2002: 52). The <em>familial</em> style was also widely accepted in Vietnamese enterprises; developed from <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/nepotism-in-the-workplace/"">family workshops</a>. In contrast, Quang and Vuong (2002) further found that a participative management style was often practised in the joint venture sector, where expatriate managers brought in Western and Japanese principles of management. Rowley and Abdul-Rahman (2008) researched the existence of convergence towards a Western style of management in Vietnamese Human Resource Management practices. They found evidence of this occurring, but argued against the use of a universal Western-inspired model of Human Resource Management and described an alternative model based on Asian values.

Following the initial review of the literature, two research questions were formulated, both very open, to allow for flexibility during the research:

<ol>
    <li>What is the role of Human Resource Management in transitioning economies?</li>
    <li>What are Human Resource Management practices in contemporary Vietnam?</li>
</ol>

The purpose of the research was not to determine how Human Resource Management in Vietnam relate to business performance, but to examine what Human Resource Management practices are actually used. The qualitative research data is analysed in detail, combined with further literature review. From the analysis, three major topics emerge.

Firstly, Vietnamese managers have a salience for management theories origination outside of Vietnam, particularly Japan and the United States.

Secondly, companies seem to rely on social networks for recruitment. This is in contrast to most Australian organisations, where public advertisements are the dominant vehicle for <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/recruitment/"">recruitment</a>. Research by Breaugh (1981: 145) showed that the source of recruitment is <93>strongly related to subsequent job performance, absenteeism and work attitudes<94> and that people recruited through newspaper advertisement missed almost twice as many days as those recruited through other sources, such as employee referrals.

The third finding is an indication that performance management in collective cultures, such as Vietnam, is more effective when aimed at improving the collective rather than focusing solely on the individual. Further detailed research is required to validate this hypothesis.

The managerial relevance of this research is to provide insight into Vietnamese Human Resource Management practices for those considering to invest or work in this country. The findings in this paper can also have implications for the way in which recruitment practices are conducted in Australia, specifically the use of social networks to find suitable candidates. The relevance of this report extends also into the academic realm as the secondary purpose of this project is to assess the usability of Grounded Theory in Human Resource Management research.

<h2>Literature Review</h2>

<h3>Human Resource Management in transitioning economies</h3>

With the introduction of Doi Moi in 1986, Vietnam has become a country with an outwardly paradoxical system, simultaneously maintaining a socialist system and a capitalist free market economy (Rowley and Abdul-Rahman 2008). This combination of socialism and capitalism seems paradoxical, but the duality of systems fits well within the Daoist inspired perspective of Vietnamese culture (Templet 1998).

A transitioning economy, such as is the case in Vietnam, is defined as one that changes from <93>plan to market<94> (Warner, Edwards, Polonsky and Pucko 2005: 3). With the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, many European countries commenced the journey towards a free market economy. Before the dramatic events in Europe, countries in Asia independently started their transition.

China introduced reform after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 and Vietnam introduced their economic restoration policy in 1986 (Warner et al. 2005). The term 'transition' is somewhat problematic as the end situation is not clearly defined. Given the unpredictability of complex processes such as macroeconomic change, the endpoint of transition cannot be known a priori (Warner et al. 2005). After the collapse of communism in Europe, Fukuyama (1992) euphorically proclaimed that this signified the final victory of the free market economy and that all countries would converge towards a unified economic system. Recent history has, however, falsified Fukuyama's predictions. The rise of Islamic banking as a viable and competitive alternative to conventional systems is a case in point (Khan and Bhatti 2008). The discussion about the nature of macroeconomic systems is complex and outside the scope of this report. Of particular interest to the Human Resource perspective is not so much the end goal, but the process of transition.

Warner et al. (2005) describe the process of transition from a centrally-planned to a free-market-economy in four dimensions (Figure 2.1). They describe a process that commences with changes in the External Economic Environment, usually the opening of foreign trade into the transitioning country. As the barriers to imports fall and more foreign products enter the market, competition in the internal market increases, which creates a link between the external and internal economic environment. In Vietnam, the start of the restoration process included a liberalisation of the import of consumer goods (Irvin 1995).

The second wave of reform is related to the Internal Economic Environment. Increased competition caused by foreign competitors entering the market leads to changes in prices as the balance of supply and demand alters. This process also involves a reform of the financial system of the transitioning country, which is an ongoing process in Vietnam (Dinh 1997; Ninh 2003; Thanh and Quang 2008). Changes in the economic system make capital more readily available and facilitate entrepreneurial activities. One major consequence of the liberalisation of the Vietnamese economy is that the number of State Owned Enterprises (SEO) has been reduced from 12,000 to 6,000 (Warner et al. 2005).

The process of divestment and privatisation of State Owned Enterprises is still underway and is managed by the State Capital Investment Corporation, who seek to divest a further 200 SEOs over the next two years (SCIC 2009). Changes in the external and internal economic environment initiate the third wave of reform, which is related to how organisations achieve their goals. Economic forces and changes in the competitive landscape cause organisations in transitioning economies to reassess their Organisational Strategy and Structure. This is the moment where businesses move from a reactive to a proactive approach in their response to the reforms. Changes in Organisational Strategy and Structure can, however, not be successful unless the Managerial Culture of an organisation evolves into a performance-based system (Warner et al. 2005).

The fourth aspect of the transitional model, Managerial Culture, involves changes in the way individual managers approach their work. The changing roles of managers in transitional economies can be linked to the often cited division of labour for managers described by Mintzberg (1971). In a planned economy, the role of managers is not as significant as in a free market model. For example, in a free market model managers are prime resource allocators, whereas in a planned economy resource allocation is controlled by politicians. This implies that the demands on managers in planned economies are lower than in a market economy. More importantly, the demands on managers in a transitioning economy, including their Human Resource Management skills, are even higher than in an established market economy (Warner et al. 2005).

The model described by Warner et al. (2005) provides a framework to analyse the processes of economic transition in countries where macroeconomic change is taking place. The framework seems to suggest a causality between the four aspects of transition in linear succession. However, each of the four aspects influences each other in a network of interdependence and reiteration of the cycle.

Changes in managerial culture improve the conditions for foreign companies to enter a country as local companies have obtained improved managerial competencies. Changes in organisational strategy and structure lead to changes in the internal economic environment because the institutions that govern the economic environment are also influenced by transitional processes. It could be argued that the process of transition is never ending, blurring the lines between a developed and developing economy in some instances. Human Resource Management plays an active role in the transitioning process as it can play a strategic role by enabling organisations to achieve their objectives (de Cieri et al. 2008; Hanson et al. 2008). In the background of the transition framework, Tradition, Society, Economy and Politics are local influences on this process of change (Warner et al. 2005).

Tradition and society are components of national culture and every management approach is deeply affected by local culture and values because management is, by its very nature, influenced by attitudes on how people are viewed in a culture (Hofstede 1996). In the next chapter, the nature of People Management (Human Resource Management) practices in Vietnam is discussed.

<h2>Human Resource Management in Hanoi</h2>

Human Resource Management is a wide and varied aspect of business management that can broadly be defined as <93>the policies, practices and systems that influence employee behaviour and performance<94> (de Cieri et al. 2008: 4). Human Resource Management practices are, in effect, a combination of applied psychology and sociology and, as such, a reflection of an organisation's view of humanity. They are a reflection of how people view themselves and the society in which they interact. As organisations are embedded in the society in which they operate, they will, therefore, reflect the culture of that country and the effectiveness of Human Resource Management practices will differ depending on the cultural landscape in which they are implemented.

Organisations in developed countries deploy a suite of practices, but it depends on the organisation's structure, goals, customer profile and societal context as to which practices are used. Given the plethora of approaches available to managers, the Western model of<a0>Human Resource Management can be considered inherently incoherent, which prompts one to question the notion of 'best practice' (Rowley and Abdul-Rahman 2008; Thang et al. 2007).

It would seem that there is a significant benefit to the HR function of a Vietnamese company becoming familiar with HR management methodologies used in developed nations. This would allow a Vietnamese company to quickly use and apply methodologies that have a good fit with the organisation's goals. However, there is the risk that a certain Human Resource Management practice currently used in Vietnamese companies, whatever those practices may be, has the potential to provide greater benefit to the company than the methodologies used in developed nations. Managers must be aware of sociocultural factors, particularly since the rational systems that originate from the developed economies tend to homogenise cultural distinctions (Hansen and Brooks 1994). The reinterpretation of HR management methodologies by Vietnamese companies may provide unexpected benefit beyond Vietnam. The introduction of total quality management into Japanese firms by W. Edwards Deming and its subsequent reinterpretation within the Japanese context has been not only a boon to Japanese firms, contributing significantly to their rapid development, but has also proven extremely beneficial and applicable to many Western firms (Gill and Wong 1998; Wren 2005). The benefits of documenting and understanding Vietnamese beneficial practices and also understanding modified practices is vital to the improving management, and in the case of this study,<a0>Human Resource Management in Vietnam, Asia, developing and developed nations alike.

When examining the Vietnamese context, it is difficult to determine whether there are intrinsically Vietnamese people-management practices without conducting in-depth comparative research. However, as suggested by Meyer (2006), there is a hazard of confirmation bias in the conduct of research when he suggested that: <93>Scholars working within existing theoretical frameworks may, in fact, limit their cognitive horizons<a0><85> Empirical tests of hypotheses derived from mainstream theories may confirm the theory, even if the overall explanatory power is weak. On the surface, firm behaviour may be sufficiently similar to allow Western theories to be tested and confirmed, yet this does not imply that the same variables are actually important in the local context.<94>

<h3>The Flow of<a0>Human Resource Management Practices</h3>

Examining HR management practices in the Vietnamese context has been conducted in the past and has provided some useful information about the attitudes toward HR management in Vietnam. Management styles in the State-Controlled sector have been found to be <93>bureaucratic, familial, conservative and authoritarian<94>, emphasising clear reporting relationships, formal communication and strict control (Quang and Vuong 2002: 52). The heritage of family workshops is widely accepted to have given rise to the <93>familial<94> style of management that is commonplace in Vietnam.

A participative work style is predominantly found in joint venture organisations (Quang and Vuong 2002) in which the Western style of management has been effectively imported to Vietnam via expatriate managers from Western Countries and Japan (Rowley and Abdul-Rahman 2008). While the work of Quang, Vuong, Rowley and Abdul-Rahman explain some aspects of<a0>Human Resource Management in Vietnam, there is a significant gap in scholarly research into Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practice. In a broader sense, a model developed by Zhu (2008) seeks to explain how management practices flow between the United States, Europe and Asia (Figure 3.1). The development of<a0>Human Resource Management methodologies in East Asia is predominantly influenced by companies operating in those countries. As economies develop to a point at which Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is liberalised and subsequently increases, as shown in the model by Warner et al. (2005) (Figure 2.1 on page 7), companies import their native<a0>Human Resource Management practices when moving to another country. In this respect,<a0>Human Resource Management practices are co-imported with foreign capital.

As foreign investment increases, there is also an increase in demand for skilled local labour. This skilled labour needs to be developed within a foreign or local education system. This is equally true for general organisational administration training, such as accounting and finance. Management training provided in Hanoi and in Western Universities appears to be mainly based upon Western management practices. As shown in the model below (Figure 3.1), the greatest flow of capital, human resources management practice and training is from the United States, where individual values and rewards are promoted (Zhu 2008).

With the strong inflow of foreign<a0>Human Resource Management practices as an economy develops, there is the risk that pre-existing practices may be lost. Through a more thorough exploration of existing<a0>Human Resource Management practices, two different but linked opportunities may be leveraged. The first opportunity is to promote and emphasise Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management to improve the success of companies operating in Vietnam. The second opportunity is the flow of beneficial<a0>Human Resource Management models from Vietnam to the rest of Asia and Western countries.

<h3>Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management Practices<97>Making the most of an opportunity</h3>

If there are pre-existing<a0>Human Resource Management practices that work particularly well within the Vietnamese context, there is an opportunity to thoroughly examine these practices and determine what works well within that context. With the opening of the Vietnamese economy to foreign investment there may be a limited window of opportunity to study and explore Vietnamese Human Resource Management, to define the endogenous practices and to document the success of these practices before they are, in effect, inundated by the<a0>Human Resource Management practices of the West and other more developed Asian nations such as Singapore and Japan.

There is a genuine and documented risk that education practices are in place that encourages, possibly inadvertently, the wholesale adoption of western<a0>Human Resource Management practices in emerging economies of Asia. Asian management scholars, notably from China, receive training in western<a0>Human Resource Management practices and are strongly encouraged to adopt these within their organisations. There is also encouragement for these scholars to publish in the top Western<a0>Human Resource Management journals (Tsui 2004).

The establishment of research and educational capacity in Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management training organisations, such as universities, would advance Asian management research. This would allow <93>scholars to shift their emphasis from theory application to developing new theories, and from benchmarking against Anglo-American models to comparative research within the region<94> (Meyer 2006: 120).

It is important to ensure that these Vietnamese practices are examined, defined, and incorporated into management training curricula. If there is a wider benefit of these management practices, then incorporation into Western models of<a0>Human Resource Management should be encouraged. As training in management theory, particularly with the rise and rise of foreign MBAs bring a greater emphasis on Western management theory, there is the risk that beneficial application of indigenous<a0>Human Resource Management may be lost to Vietnam and the rest of the world.

<h3>Wider benefit of Vietnamese Human Resource Management</h3>

The benefit of Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practices being defined and applied in Vietnam is almost self-evident. It is more likely that the application of Vietnamese Human Resource Management practices will be successful and more beneficial because they have been developed within a single societal framework. However, there may be more benefit to understanding Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practices. As can be seen in Figure 3.1, while the predominant flow of<a0>Human Resource Management practices is from the United States into Asia and Europe, there are also flows from Asia to Europe and the United States. Understanding Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practices are likely to have the benefit of assisting Western countries to better manage their FDI efforts in Vietnam and there may be the additional benefit in promoting Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practices in their associated organisations in the West.

The adoption of Western<a0>Human Resource Management practices in Vietnam may also have additional benefits outside of Vietnam. It is likely that scholars will apply their Western<a0>Human Resource Management training in their Vietnamese companies and will find that some practices will work and others will require modification to be successful. It is the modification of Western<a0>Human Resource Management practices in the Vietnamese context that may lead to improved management techniques that are applicable not only to Vietnam but also to Western<a0>Human Resource Management much as Deming's introduction of Western Management practices in Japan had significant benefit to the rest of the world.

<h3>The way forward</h3>

As described above, although some studies have been conducted (Budhwar 2009; Kamoche 2001; Nguyen 2002; Nguyen and Bryant 2004), there is a significant gap in the understanding of<a0>Human Resource Management practices that are currently being used in Vietnam. The transmission of<a0>Human Resource Management practices from the West does have benefit to Vietnamese organisations but also creates a risk that pre-existing Vietnamese<a0>Human Resource Management practices may be lost. It is through research that these practices may be defined, documented, and incorporated into HR training curricula in both Vietnam and the West. This will have a clear benefit for Vietnamese managers and, potentially, HR practitioners throughout the world.

This research project seeks to draw out Vietnamese management practices, to contribute to filling this gap in knowledge and help managers employ tools to assist with maximising the performance and well being of workers throughout Vietnam, Asia and the Western world.

<h2>Research Method</h2>

Formal interviews have been conducted in five privately-owned organisations, selected by Hanoi University, a research partner of the Graduate School of Management. Two of the interviewees were European managers working for Vietnamese companies. All respondents were university educated males between the age of 30 and 50. Only three interviews were dedicated to Human Resource Management as respondents were shared with other research groups in the Hanoi expedition.

The research was undertaken following the Straussian school of Grounded Theory (Jones and Noble 2007). All interviews were conducted very openly and covering a wide range of topics across the field of Human Resource Management (Appendix B on page 50) and no hypothesis was defined prior to the data collection process. The questionnaire was loosely followed to allow for an open dialogue between the interviewers and the respondents. Depending on the reaction of the respondent, certain topics were discussed in more detail than was the case with other interviews. This method of interviewing allowed for greater flexibility and for gathering contextually rich information. It also provided an atmosphere in which participants were more open to providing data than in a closed interview.

All participants were fully informed about the purpose of the interview by means of a Participant Consent Form. This contained, besides the consent form, also a form to withdraw consent and an outline of the general purpose of the expedition. This form did, however, not contain a return address to submit the request and as such, no withdrawals have been received. One participant was willing to be interviewed but refused to sign the consent form. The interview continued, but the data has not been used in the report. All data obtained from the interviews remain confidential. Participating organisations and managers have been deidentified in this report. The raw research data is kept by the authors and will be destroyed after the results of the subject have been published by the University.

A collective application for all research groups in the Hanoi expedition was submitted to the University Human Ethics Committee (UHEC). The application excludes recording of the interview. No verbatim transcripts have thus been prepared and analysis relied solely on notes taken during the interview. Although some proponents of grounded theory argue against taping and transcribing of interviews (Charmaz 2006), it was found to be a restrictive requirement for this research. In one interview, the respondent was a German expatriate who only spoke Vietnamese and German. Since no Vietnamese translator was present, one of the researchers conducted the interview in German, simultaneously translating to the other researchers and taking notes. The directive not to record interviews restricted the research and constrained the quality of the data as the dynamics of the interview not always allowed accurate note-taking.

After each interview, the raw notes were transcribed by both researchers and in those cases where both were present, notes were compared to ensure consistency. The raw data were collated into a single document and coded in accordance with the standard procedures in Grounded Theory, as described in the previous chapter. After Coding, seven categories emerged from the data, some of which with their own subcategories. Sorting of all data revealed that some categories are linked to each other (such as Motivation and Reward).

A semantic diagram was used to prepare a memo for each category. Extensive memoing has been undertaken during the expedition itself and the analysis was substantially complete upon returning to Australia.

[caption id=""attachment_406"" align=""alignnone"" width=""856""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-406"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2010/06/Semantik.png"" alt="""" width=""856"" height=""629"" /> Figure 5.1 Semanic diagram.[/caption]

Based on this information, three categories were selected for further analysis, i.e. Vietnamese Style Human Resource Management, Recruitment and Motivation. Further literature review on the selected categories has been undertaken, enabling the formulation of three hypotheses. The limited amount of data did not allow drawing any firm conclusions about these phenomena. The last step in the research was the identification of a Core Category. It was found that the Core Category, binding all observed phenomena, is Collectivism. In order to stay as close as possible to the original words of the respondents, the raw data has been transcribed into four vignettes, which are provided in the next chapter, after which a detailed analysis of the data is provided.

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Company A</h3>

Mr A is the manager of a business department in a large distribution company based in Hanoi. The core competency of this organisation is the export and import of rice. In excellent English, Mr A explained that the business has recently horizontally expanded into the retail industry and currently operates some convenience stores and a supermarket in the city. They are committed to expanding their presence in retail but are on a steep learning curve.

They struggle with overseas competition because foreign companies have easier access to capital, better knowledge of the retail industry and better Human Resource Management systems. The main issue is that overseas companies have good training models and a <93>HR structure<94>. Company A is developing and implementing a suitable HRM approach with the assistance of consultants. They use Japanese and Western models as a reference, but select only those aspects they find suitable. Mr A smilingly said: <93>Western or Japanese model is not suitable<94>, but he did not provide details on how he determines which methods are more likely to be suitable.

<h3>Company B</h3>

Mr B is the manager of a large department store that focuses on home improvement, furniture and related products. He was expatriated from Germany a few months prior to the interview, which was conducted in German. He experiences difficulties in transforming the business because Vietnamese managers shy away from internal conflict and are always looking for harmony. Mr B is of the opinion that some internal conflict is required to make the business more successful. When asked his view on what it takes to be successful an European manager in Vietnam he resolutely answered: <93>adapt or die<94>.

He believes that the rate of social change in Vietnam is very fast and he anticipates social unrest because of this. Not in the form of riots or demonstrations, but through <93>passivit<e4>t<94>, best translated as passive resistance against capitalist values.

He experiences trouble motivating local staff and showed statistics that the labour cost to turnover ratio in Vietnam is more than four times higher than in Germany. One of the reasons for this is that almost half of the store's employees are security staff. Shoplifting is a big problem and to deter people from stealing, photos of shoplifters that were caught are displayed at the store entrance. Mr B believes this works as a deterrent because it is a way to ensure that shoplifters literally lose face.

Individual productivity is, as shown by the above figures, very low in his business. Mr B believes this is a leftover of the transition from a Planned Economy, with high job security and no drivers to increase productivity. Being from former East Germany, he has seen a similar transition. However, he is of the opinion that the uptake of capitalist values by his staff is going slowly compared to his own experience. He said that the Vietnamese have an expectation of a job for life, without the requirement to be productive.

The business is introducing Key Performance Indicator (KPI) based salaries. He believes, however, that it is more important to reward subjective measures first because these are most lacking, i.e. keeping the store clean, correct merchandising and so on, rather than focusing on sales volumes. This relates back to the problems with staff motivation mentioned earlier.

<h3>Company C</h3>

Mr C is the Finance Manager of a privately owned distribution and logistics company that maintains trucks and warehouses, employing about 2,000 people.

When Company C recruits staff, they follow a three-step process. First, they review existing staff, then they use informal networks to find suitable people. Last option is to use a Headhunter, i.e. external recruitment agencies. The selection process depends on the vacancy they seek to fill. For middle and lower staff, the process involves psychological testing (IQ) and practical tests to ascertain whether they are suitable. For high-level positions, no testing is undertaken and Company C relies on references. Interviews with applicants are undertaken after the testing or obtaining references.

An important selection criterion for Company C is the applicant's perceived adaptability to their business culture. They target Vietnamese people that work at multinational corporations (MNC) because of their experience with working in an occidental management environment. However, these people find it hard to fit back into a Vietnamese business after working for an MNC.

The main difference between Company C and an internationally owned company is that in the latter, everything is very procedurised by using <93>SOP or something like that<94>, they follow <93>steps A, B and C<94>. In Company C there are no strict procedures to be followed and some people, particularly those that have worked for an MNC for a while, <93>get confused about what to do next<94>. They need staff who are able to work in this environment.

Company C wants to upgrade their HR systems to match that of MNCs that operate in Vietnam. They believe the best way to achieve this is to use a western HRM model, adapted to Vietnamese culture. Mr C reads Western management textbooks but chooses selectively on what to apply. They try to duplicate the systems used by MNC in Vietnam.

In Company C, lower and middle staff follow training on the job. They are developing the <93>soft skills<94> of middle management. There are no cultural issues with implementing western HRM models in the lower echelons because <93>lower people follow orders<94>. Vietnamese people are not fond of personal development beyond a certain point. There is currently no culture of <93>learning forever<94>. This is the old attitude and Mr C believes that a future recession will change that mindset.

Salaries are based on Key Performance Indicators, but they are different for each department. In sales, 20-30% of salary is dependent upon achievement sales volumes. Most staff members have individual KPIs. Secondary conditions such as annual leave, healthcare and share options exist for higher level positions. Tertiary conditions focus around staff outings, which is a Vietnamese tradition.

<h3>Company D</h3>

Company D is active in the hospitality industry and operates several pubs and restaurants in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, targeting Western expatriates and travellers. Mr D is the part owner and manager of the business. He is originally from the United Kingdom and moved to Hanoi several years ago. He speaks Vietnamese and is able to communicate with staff in their own language. Mr D has no formal management education and has a background in retail and pubs in England. This is where he has obtained a keen insight in the marketing of services.

One of the other owners of Company D also owns a charity in which street children are provided with an opportunity to be trained in hospitality. Through this connection, Company D is operated with a strong sense of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/milton-friedman-corporate-social-responsibility/"">social corporate responsibility</a>. There is a strict separation between the charity and the business and they thus do not hire graduates from the charity. Company D recruits most of its staff from the groups of people that were not able to obtain a place in the charity training program but are considered suitable. The selection is followed by a conversation with Mr D, another manager and a Vietnamese staff member. The candidate has already been selected, so this is only an introduction to the business. Company D occasionally uses social networks to find new staff and expert jobs, such as accountants, are advertised. The success of their approach is illustrated by one girl who used to sell eggs in the street, became a cashier and is now studying to be an accountant.

The company focuses strongly on training and Mr D proudly mentioned that a former waitress, who is now the training manager of Company D, will soon move to Melbourne to undertake hospitality training at TAFE. Most new recruits are about 20 years old and have a basic knowledge of English because they used to shine shoes or sell lighters and so on. Because most new recruits are former street children, training of new staff members with the basics, including personal hygiene. All training is undertaken in-house through a mentoring system and for large groups by the training manager.

They just opened a new restaurant, which took six months to train all staff. New recruits have three months to learn the trade and start <93>busting tables and cleaning ashtrays<94>. Mr D is developing a staff handbook in Vietnamese and English. The handbook focuses on their rights and provides an overview of organisational values.

Company C provides a wide range of benefits, including help with accommodation, interest-free loans, vaccinations, English classes, a medical program (they even paid for heart surgery for one staff member) and a medical checks. They also provide a uniform and some new clothes for new staff, because they have no wardrobe of their own.

Some successful staff have been given a share in the company as a bonus. These are full shares which make them eligible to become a company director. They also provide free meals to staff when they are at work. Salary is performance-based, which is measured subjectively through conversation with their mentor. Some staff have doubled their salary in three months. Every two years they take their staff on an all expenses paid trip. They also provide transport to weddings and funerals.

It is a company rule that staff are not supposed to stand still and always look for an opportunity to provide customer service. Mr D said that Vietnamese jobs are usually quiet inactive and it takes some effort to ingrain this behaviour. Mr D also recounted an episode where he publicly escorted a staff member out of the premises because he was caught stealing. This caused problems for him because both the staff member and he lost face.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

From the data, seven categories emerged, some with their own subcategories:

<ol>
    <li>Vietnamese Style Human Resource Management</li>
    <li>Reward (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary)</li>
    <li>Recruitment (Social Networks and Formal)</li>
    <li>Legal</li>
    <li>Training &amp; Development (Western Education and In-house provision)</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Culture (Face and Collectivism)</li>
</ol>

Analyses of the data showed that Reward and Motivation are closely related and that three categories, Vietnamese Style Human Resource Management, Recruitment and Rewards &amp; Motivation, provided the best opportunities for theory building.

<h3>Vietnamese Human Resource Management</h3>

A recurring topic in all interviews was the existence and nature of a Vietnamese style of Human Resource Management. Most companies were in the process of researching Western and Japanese<a0>Human Resource Management methodologies and implementing these in their own organisations. There was a strong perception among the interviewed Vietnamese managers that the Western model of<a0>Human Resource Management is something to strive for. Although, methods were used selectively to ensure organisational and cultural fit.

Interviewees were not able to pinpoint the type of methodologies they believed to be suitable in a Vietnamese context and which were not. Vietnamese managers are embedded in their own culture and are not necessarily acutely self-aware of the differences between occidental and oriental culture. The fact that they have a personal preference for a certain management approach is an illustration of the culture in which they are embedded.

The need to research the suitability of existing management methodologies in emerging countries has been identified by several scholars (Budhwar 2009; Meyer 2006; Rowley and Abdul-Rahman 2008). Recent research by Thang et al. (2007) has shown that foreign practices which tend to be in harmony with the norms, beliefs and assumptions of Vietnamese culture have the best chance to improve business performance. Practices that are based on confrontation or impose ethnocentric methods are likely to fail. This was illustrated by Mr B, who lamented that Vietnamese managers in his organisation shy away from confrontation, something which he saw as necessary to create a healthy dialogue. This is consistent with the pluralistic approach preferred in Europe, as shown in Figure 3.1.

Another aspect that was mentioned in several interviews and site visits was management training. Most managers expressed a preference for a Western-style management education. Larger companies send their people overseas to further their education. This aligns with the common Vietnamese tendency to prefer foreign products over locally made things. This attitude can be traced back to the time before Doi Moi, typified by a lack of quantity and quality of consumer goods (Thang et al. 2007: 125). The popularity of Western management education in Vietnam can also be seen as a result of the many development projects over the past decades, providing management education (Napier 2008).

From the observed salience for foreign Human Resource Management approaches a first hypothesis can be formulated.

<blockquote>H1 : Vietnamese managers have a preference for adopting Human Resource Management practices with a foreign origin.</blockquote>

This hypothesis may actually be proven incorrect in that the co-importation of capital and<a0>Human Resource Management practices outlined in Chapter 3 has led to Western Human Resource Management training being more widely available rather than being preferred. No firm conclusion can be drawn from the obtained data.

<h3>Reward &amp; Motivation</h3>

Reward mechanisms can be categorised into three distinct types. Primary reward is the monetary remuneration an employee receives. Secondary reward refers to all non-financial entitlements, such as annual leave, lunch breaks and so on. Tertiary reward refers to the social benefits of being part of an organisation, but which are not part of the formal employment relationship. Primary reward mechanisms outlined in the site visits and interviews all follow methodologies very familiar to those used in Australian organisations, i.e. a focus on individual reward. All companies use a salary scale to value different jobs and maintain a bonus system to reward the performance of staff. A secondary reward was provided in all organisations in accordance with the Labour Laws of Vietnam (Chee and Dung 2008).

Most interesting was the emphasis of many organisations on tertiary rewards, such as staff outings, interest-free loans, transport to weddings and funerals, buying the occasional unexpected gift and also providing a <93>pleasant workspace<94> was mentioned. One company that excelled in this area was Company D. The businesses they manage are well known among travellers and expatriates in Hanoi and Ho Chi Min City because of the excellent service provided by staff. Staff seem to be much more motivated to provide great service than in other Vietnamese businesses. For example, in Company B, the manager expressed that staff were not self-motivated to provide service, which he attributed to Vietnamese culture. While Company D focuses on tertiary rewards and is achieving great results, Company B focuses on individual rewards and faces motivation problems. From these observations a second hypothesis can be formulated:

<blockquote>H2 : In collectivist cultures, tertiary rewards are more likely to motivate staff than primary and secondary rewards.</blockquote>

The hypothesis is theoretically supported through Vroom's Expectancy Theory (Robbins and Judge 2007) and empirical research that indicates that Vietnam and most other South-East Asian countries are collectivist in nature (Hofstede 1993).

According to Vroom, who follows a behaviourist model of psychology, the <93>strength of a tendency to act in a certain way depends on the strength of an expectation that the act will be followed by an outcome and on the attractiveness of that outcome<94> (Robbins and Judge 2007: 208). Vroom's model uses three concepts to explain motivation.

[caption id=""attachment_3650"" align=""alignnone"" width=""525""]<img class=""size-large wp-image-3650"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2009/06/expectancy-1-1024x134.png"" alt=""Expectancy Theory (Robbins and Judge 2007: 208)."" width=""525"" height=""69"" /> Expectancy Theory (Robbins and Judge 2007: 208).[/caption]

<ol>
    <li>Expectancy: the likelihood, as perceived by the individual, that exerting a given amount of effort will lead to performance.</li>
    <li>Instrumentality: the degree to which the individual is convinced that performing at a certain level will lead to desired rewards.</li>
    <li>Valance: the degree to which organisational rewards match an individual's personal goals.</li>
</ol>

The basic utility of Expectancy Theory is that, in order to enhance the performance of individuals, rewards need to be linked to the required behaviour and that these rewards are anticipated and wanted by employees. An employment relationship is underpinned by principles of mutuality and reciprocity (Heap 2008) in that employees expect a return for their efforts, as outlined in Expectancy Theory.

A return can be provided to employees on three levels, as outlined above. Following the principle of Valance in Vroom's theory, rewards in a society with a predominantly collective nature should reflect this. In other words, a focus on tertiary rewards and social benefits will theoretically lead to a better performance outcome.

The data obtained in this research does, however, not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or falsify this hypothesis and further researched is required to test its validity.

<h3>Recruitment &amp; Selection</h3>

The third result emerging from the data is the preference for social networks in the recruitment of new staff, this contrasts with Australian firms where newspaper advertisements are the prevalent way to attract applicants to new positions (Wooden and Harding 1998). The third hypothesis is thus:

<blockquote>H3 : Recruitment in countries with a collective nature, such as Vietnam, is primarily conducted through social networks.</blockquote>

The purpose of recruitment is to communicate the existence of a vacancy to those segments of the job market that an organisation seeks to recruit from (de Cieriet al. 2008). The recruitment process is influenced by several factors, as illustrated in figure Figure 7.2.

It is the recruiter's task to increase the likelihood of a match between the applicant and vacancy characteristics, in other words, to achieve job fit<92>. Job fit is bidirectional as vacancy characteristics need to match applicant characteristics and vice versa. Only a bidirectional job fit ensures that the incumbent will be in the best possible position to contribute positively to the organisation. This is achieved by controlling the three influencing factors. Human resource policies affect the characteristics of the vacancy (job design). Recruitment sources determine which segment of the job market is targeted and thus influence applicant characteristics. The recruiters themselves also influence the job choice through their impact on both job design and applicant characteristics. Using social networks as a source of recruitment influences applicant characteristics because the criteria upon which the social network is defined determine who will be considered for the position.

Breaugh (1981: 145) showed that the source of recruitment is <93>strongly related to subsequent job performance, absenteeism and work attitudes<94>. People placed through universities and to a lesser extent those sourced through newspapers were <93>inferior in performance<94> to applicants who were sourced through advertisements in professional publications (Breaugh 1981: 145), which is a form of social network. People recruited through newspaper advertisement missed almost twice as many days as those recruited through other sources, such as employee referrals (Breaugh 1981). The field study was conducted in one particular research organisation in the USA.

[caption id=""attachment_3651"" align=""alignnone"" width=""525""]<img class=""size-large wp-image-3651"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2009/06/recruitment-1024x517.png"" alt=""Factors influencing the recruitment process (de Cieri et al. 2008: 260)."" width=""525"" height=""265"" /> Factors influencing the recruitment process (de Cieri et al. 2008: 260).[/caption]

A possible explanation of this phenomenon is the Individual Difference Hypothesis in which it is stated that recruitment sources differ in the types of the applicants they reach (education, class, self-image and so on), which results in different performance outcomes. Following this theory, people recruited through employee referrals may be more capable or have a better cultural fit than individuals recruited from public sources because current employees and other members of the social network screen potential applicants before they consider them for a position in the organisation as their own reputation is at stake (Breaugh and Starke 2000).

It should be noted that recruitment and selection are two distinctly different aspects of Human Resource Management. Although people are recruited because they are a member of a social network, this does not imply that they are necessarily selected because of this. All respondents acknowledged that an interview formed part of the selection process and in some instances, psychological and technical aptitude tests were used to determine the most suitable candidate.

<h3>Core Category</h3>

Following the analysis of the identified categories, a core category emerged. The core category, i.e. the concept that ties the findings together, is the collective nature of Vietnamese society. This concept has been widely discussed in management literature, spearheaded by the research undertaken by Dutch sociologist Geert Hofstede (1983).

Collectivism emphasises human interdependence and the importance of a group. On the other end of the spectrum, individualism is the degree to which people give primacy to the individual over the group to which they belong. Countries with a high level of individualism (IDV, see Figure 7.3), such as Australia, prioritise individual rights over the rights of the collective. In countries with low scores in IDV, the collectivist societies, such as Vietnam, the rights of the individual are often subordinated to the collective (Hofstede 1983, 1993). The preference for using social networks as a means of recruiting staff is an expression of the collective nature of Vietnamese culture. Although this research was conducted with limited data, the preference for social network recruiting was also confirmed in many informal conversations with Vietnamese managers not partaking in the interviews.

The use of social networks is contrasted with the preference of newspaper advertisements in Australian firms, as identified by Wooden and Harding (1998). This is in line with the core category as Australia is considered an individualistic country (Figure 7.3) and newspaper advertisements focus on random individuals. Collectivism was apparent in how businesses manage staff performance. There seems to be a focus on tertiary rewards, which are also an expression of the collectivist nature of Vietnam. With regards to Primary and Secondary rewards, Thang et al. (2007) investigated the transferability of occidental management practices into Vietnam and found that individualism is one of the underlying assumptions for a pay-for-performance system. The long-held Confucian collectivist values in Vietnamese society will, however, make it difficult for these methods to be successful. A pay for performance system is more likely to be applicable to the younger generations. As the per capita, Gross Domestic Product of Vietnam rises, the level of individualism is also expected to rise, as shown by Hofstede (1993).

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<blockquote>They say you come to Vietnam and you understand a lot in a few minutes.
But the rest has got to be lived.
Graham Greene (1977), <em>The Quiet American</em>.</blockquote>

The research in Vietnam and associated literature review has unearthed some interesting prospects for further research into Human Resource Management in this country.

Firstly, even only a very limited amount of interviews were conducted, the contextually rich nature of the data and using the Grounded Theory approach allowed for the formulation of some promising hypotheses. It is, however, because of the limited number of observations that were able to be made that the results can only be considered hypotheses at this time. Grounded Theory is thus a potentially successful method for researching Human Resource Management practices in Vietnam. Given that many scholars recommend in-depth research in this region an opportunity is created to enhance the findings of this report through follow-up studies.

The first hypothesis states that Vietnamese managers have a preference for adopting Human Resource Management practices with a foreign origin. This preference may be because of a perceived superiority of foreign models or simply because Vietnamese practices are not very well documented. This illustrates the importance of foundational research into the actual methods used in Vietnamese organisations in order to be able to enhance the global body of knowledge in this area.

The second hypotheses, which states that in collectivist cultures, tertiary rewards are more likely to motivate staff than primary and secondary rewards, is based on only two observations but is supported by Vroom's expectancy theory and Hofstede's work on national cultures. Should this assertion be proven to be correct after subsequent research, it may have a significant impact on how both Vietnamese and foreign companies structure their reward portfolio.

Lastly, the finding that recruitment in the researched organisations is primarily conducted through social networks, combined with earlier research on correlations between recruitment source and staff performance, warrants further research. Australian organisations cast wide nets in their search for new staff members by advertising in newspapers distributed to anyone with an interest in local matters. If this hypothesis is confirmed, a model can be developed to manage social network recruiting, which could possibly lead to lower recruitment cost. This would be a recognition of Vietnamese Human Resource Management and alleviate the need to introduce models from the USA, which have shown to be not always successful.

<blockquote><85> there is one and only one social responsibility of business to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays in the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without deception or fraud.</blockquote>

This statement raises the question of whether directors can act in any way to increase profits. Although Friedman is clear that directors as agents of the business have to play within the rules of the game, this still leaves room for unethical behaviour. Does this mean that directors can act in any way to increase profits?

A further question raised by his article is whether corporations should engage in socially responsible activities. In this essay, Milton Friedman's view is discussed and contrasted with the socio-economic view of Corporate Social Responsibility. It will be argued that directors cannot act in any way to increase profits and that corporations should engage in socially responsible activities as it can be shown that they at least have an indirect positive effect on organisational performance.

<h2>Milton Friedman and Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>

Friedman argued for a direct form of capitalism and against any activity that distorts economic freedom.[note]Hammond, J.D. (2003) Remembering Economics. <em>Journal of the History of Economic Thought</em> 25(2): 133<96>143.[/note] Socially responsible activities conducted by a corporation are, according to Friedman, distorting economic freedom because shareholders are not able to decide how their money will be spent. Friedman thus argues that corporations should focus on those activities that are causally related to company profit, effectively excluding charitable activities that do not directly generate revenue:[note]Friedman 1962: 135.[/note]

<blockquote><85>[there] has been the claim that business should contribute to support charitable activities and especially to universities. Such giving by corporations is an inappropriate use of corporate funds in a free-enterprise society.</blockquote>

Another principle expressed by Milton Friedman is the need to stay within the rules of the game, explicitly avoiding deception and fraud. This principle is further clarified when he writes:[note]Friedman 1970.[/note]

<blockquote>A corporate executive <85> has direct responsibility to conduct business in accordance with[shareholder] desires <85>[i.e.] to make as much money as possible while conforming to their basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.</blockquote>

This quotation implies that Friedman does not proclaim that directors can act in any way to maximise profit as they have to abide by the law and follow ethical custom. He, however, excludes explicitly charitable activities as they do not directly contribute to profit. A good corporation in Milton Friedman's view is not one that undertakes activities only because they are ethically sound, but because they are economically viable. One of Friedman's main arguments for excluding Corporate Social Responsibility from business stems from his views on the ethical spending:[note]Waldman, D.A. and Siegel, D. (2008) Defining the socially responsible leader. <em>The Leadership Quarterly</em> 19(1): 117<96>131.[/note]

<ul>
    <li>Your money on yourself<97>spent wisely;</li>
    <li>Your money on others<97>spend wisely but challenging;</li>
    <li>People's money on yourself<97>little incentive to economise;</li>
    <li>People's money on other people<97> the role of government and Corporate Social Responsibility programmes.</li>
</ul>

Friedman argues that it is not appropriate for a corporate executive or director to embark on socially responsible programmes because there is little incentive for prudent expenditure, mainly when one is spending money owed to the shareholders through dividends.[note]Friedman 1962.[/note]
Friedman (1962) proclaimed that a corporation is a morally neutral legal construct with maximising returns for shareholders as its single purpose. Directors and executives of a corporation are employed to achieve this sole objective. The only moral responsibility of directors and executives is to meet shareholder expectations, which is to maximise their return on investment.

Friedman's view is akin to social Darwinism, applying the survival of the fittest principle to the market to ensure the best of all possible outcomes. Friedman interprets this principle as the corporation with the highest return to shareholders. When the issue of an electric company that cut supply to a customer for non-payment upon which the customer died as a consequence was presented to Friedman, he applied the Kantian view to justify their actions. He argued that a utility company that does not cut off electricity to non-paying customers would perish as there is no reason for customers to pay their bills.[note]Milton Friedman (1978) <em>Milton Friedman Speaks</em> (Video). <em>The Idea Channel</em>. Extract available at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev_Uph_TLLo"">www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev_Uph_TLLo</a>. Accessed 6 July 2009.[/note] In Friedman's view, disconnecting non-paying customers has to be regarded as a universal maxim, regardless of the specific outcomes. He considers this as ethical because the directors have a moral duty to ensure the survival of the corporation.

<h2>Socio-economic School</h2>

The counterpoint to Friedman's view is developed in the socio-economic school of Corporate Social Responsibility. One of the leading proponents of this view proposed the Iron Law of Responsibility,[note]Davis, K. (1960) Can business afford to ignore social responsibilities. <em>California Management Review</em> 2(3): 70<96>76, p.71.[/note] which holds that the <93>social responsibilities of businessmen need to be commensurate with their social power<94>, which was further built upon by Frederick:[note]Frederick, W.C. (1960) The growing concern over business responsibility. <em>California Management Review</em> 2(4): 54<96>61.[/note]

<blockquote><85> businessmen should oversee the operation of an economic system that fulfils the expectations of the public. And this means in turn that the economy's means of production should be employed in such a way that production and distribution should enhance total socio-economic welfare.</blockquote>

The socio-economic view is a utilitarian argument as Frederick (1960:60) emphasises that the total socio-economic welfare of society should be enhanced, rather than focusing on the well-being of shareholders, as Friedman proclaimed. Companies that operate exclusively for the sake of maximising shareholder return and thus do not engage in socially responsible activities are considered unethical in the utilitarian point of view. Following the utilitarian adage of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people,[note]Kennett, Jeanette and Townsend, Aubrey, eds. (1998) <em>Ethics. Unit Study Guide</em>. Monash University.[/note] companies are ethically obliged to participate in socially responsible activities that maximise the total welfare of all stakeholders. There is, however, a problem with applying standard consequentialist theories where we are required to maximise agent-neutral value.[note]Kennett and Townsend 1998.[/note] Utilitarianism does not distinguish between people whose utility should be maximised and thus requires a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/environmental-ethics-for-managers-deontic-constraints/"">deontic constraint</a> to ensure that maximisation of the welfare of all stakeholders does not jeopardise the long-term prospects of the business. A deontic constraint is a principle that assigns a value to individual agents over others[note]Kennett and Townsend 1998.[/note], and in the case of corporate social responsibility, it could be argued that the rights of the shareholders should be protected in preference of the rights of the whole of society.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

If corporate social responsibility is detrimental to business, as suggested by Friedman, then shareholders will tend to avoid investing in companies that act socially responsible. There is, however, empirical evidence that this is not the case. Firstly, Friedman fails to acknowledge that acting ethically can be a valuable marketing proposition. By understanding the desires of consumers, a corporation can offer products and services that match their ethical thresholds, thereby adding value to both shareholders and consumers, thus avoiding marketing myopia as described by Theodore Levitt.[note]Levitt, Theodore (1960) Marketing Myopia. <em>Harvard Business Review</em> 38(4):45<96>56.[/note]

Consumers prefer products and services that make claims of social responsibility on product labels.[note]Hiscox, M.J. and Smyth, N.F.B. (2006) <em>Is There Consumer Demand for Improved Labor Standards? Evidence from Field Experiments in Social Labelling</em>. Department of Government, Harvard University.[/note] Herzberg's Motivator-Hygiene Theory theoretically supports this research.[note]Herzberg, F., Mausner, B. and Snyderman, B.B. (1959) <em>The motivation to work</em>. New York: John Wiley.[/note] Hygiene Factors are minimum conditions that must be met in the workplace to prevent work dissatisfaction. Meijer and Schuyt examined the role of Corporate Social Responsibility in purchasing behaviour and found that for Dutch consumers, corporate social performance serves more as a Hygiene Factor than as a Motivator. Interestingly, this behaviour was not related to household income.[note]Meijer, M.M. and Schuyt, T. (2005) Corporate social performance as a bottom line for consumers. <em>Business &amp; Society</em> 44(4): 442<96>461.[/note]

Secondly, the growth of ethical investments demonstrates that some investors prefer organisations that do not seek profit maximisation by imposing ethical constraints on their operations.[note]Guay, T., Doh, J.P. and Sinclair, G. (2004) Non-governmental organisations, shareholder activism, and socially responsible investments: ethical, strategic, and governance implications. <em>Journal of Business Ethics</em> 52(1): 125<96>139.[/note] There is also a clear case to be made that Motivator-Hygiene Theory can be applied to shareholders. Executives and directors that behave unethically create significant shareholder dissatisfaction, as demonstrated by the many recent examples or corporate misbehaviour.[note]Carson, T.L. (2003) Self-interest and business ethics: Some lessons of the recent corporate scandals. <em>Journal of Business Ethics</em> 43(4): 389<96>394.[/note]

Lastly, a meta-study undertaken by Griffin and Mahon showed that there is no consensus on a causal relationship between the level of socially responsible spending and business performance or shareholder satisfaction.[note]Griffin, J.J. and Mahon, J.F. (1997) The corporate social performance and corporate financial performance debate: Twenty-five years of incomparable research. <em>Business &amp; Society</em> 36(1): 5<96>31.[/note] There are also reports that both prove and disprove the hypothesis within the same company, depending on which performance measure is analysed and when the data is collected.[note]Pava, M.L. and Krausz, J. (1996) The association between corporate social responsibility and financial performance: The paradox of social cost. <em>Journal of Business Ethics</em> 15(3): 321<96>357.[/note]

<h2>Milton Friedman on Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>

Milton Friedman argued vehemently against spending shareholder's money for anything that does not directly contribute to increasing shareholder wealth. He took the Kantian view that directors must look after the interests of shareholders, which seek wealth maximisation. As socially responsible activities, in the opinion of Friedman, reduce wealth, companies should not engage in any charitable activities.

The socio-economic view claims that companies should maximise the good for the greatest number of people. Following a utilitarian strand of thought, this view holds that companies should engage in socially responsible actions because it maximises the wealth of all stakeholders. However, to ensure that financial sustainability of the corporation is not eroded, deontic constraints that recognise the right of shareholders to a reasonable return, need to be put in place.

In conclusion, directors do not have total freedom to maximise profit as they have to act within both the legal and ethical rules of the game. Furthermore, for companies to be genuinely ethical, they should engage in a reasonable level of socially responsible activities as this maximises the wealth of all stakeholders.

57,environmental-ethics-for-managers-deontic-constraints,Environmental Ethics for Managers and the Role of Deontic Constraints,"What responsibility does a manager have concerning environmental ethics? Mr Freeman was a model citizen with a long career in public service. In 2003 he held the position of Director of Infrastructure at the Port Macquarie-Hasting Council and was responsible for the implementation of infrastructure works. However, this year Mr Freeman paid a hefty personal price after an error of judgement destroyed the habitat of two threatened animal species during road construction project (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009). This case is of importance because Justice Lloyd pierced the corporate veil for environmental offences by holding Mr Freeman partially personally accountable for the damage caused by the construction works (Blake Dawson 2009; Thomas 2009).

<blockquote>Justice Lloyd pierced the corporate veil for environmental offences.</blockquote>

This essay discusses the Corporate Governance aspects of this case from the stakeholder perspective and an ethical perspective. A combination of utilitarian and Kantian environmental<a0>ethics is used to argue that the Council failed to recognise the environment as a stakeholder and as such gave preference to potential financial gain over the environmental damage. Furthermore, it is recommended that governance systems based on ISO 14001 could have prevented the destruction of habitat.

In 2003, Port Macquarie-Hasting Council (the Council) engaged in the construction of roadworks on land owned by the Council in an area known as Partridge Creek. Mr Freeman was responsible for overseeing these works. As part of the preparation for this project, several environmental assessments were undertaken, and the Council was aware that this land is a habitat of the Grass Owl and the Eastern Chestnut Mouse, both listed as threatened species. Construction works commenced, ignoring this information and destroyed habitat for these species (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2007, 2009).

Council and Mr Freeman were prosecuted by Mr Garrett, representing the Department of Environment and Conservation. Justice Lloyd found that Council<92>s system of works to mitigate environmental risk had failed in that Mr Freeman <93>completed a tick-a-box checklist which did not even mention the threatened species<94> (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009: 28). One of Mr Freedman<92>s defences was that he had no training in environmental assessments and that no manuals were available and he thus could not be held liable for the quality of the evaluations.

Justice Lloyd found this not to be a sufficient defence (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009: 81). Justice Lloyd further observed that:<a0><93><85> as a director and sometimes acting General Manager of the council Mr Freeman ought to have made proper efforts to find out what was required for a proper assessment after having become aware that such an assessment was required<94> (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009: 162).

Both the Council and Mr Freedman were found guilty. Mr Freeman was convicted of paying $57,000 in fines and $167,500 prosecutor<92>s costs. Council was convicted of paying similar amounts (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009). The proceedings against the Council and Mr Freeman have prompted improvements to the way projects are managed, including a project management facilitation process aimed at ensuring there is a documented and accountable process for projects planning and obtaining approvals. Environmental checklists have been rewritten, and measures to ensure that staff are properly trained to have been implemented (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009; Port Macquarie-Hastings Council 2007: 163).

<h2>Stakeholder Perspective</h2>

Given that Port Macquarie-Hastings Council is not a corporation in the traditional sense of the word, i.e. it is not owned by shareholders, the standard owner-centric model for corporations cannot be applied to this case. The Council is therefore viewed from the stakeholder perspective. A stakeholder is any person or organisation that has an interest in the dealings of the Council (Du Plessis et al. 2005). In this model, directors and managers have a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/milton-friedman-corporate-social-responsibility/"">responsibility to all stakeholders</a>, including the owners. Management must look after the health of the organisation, balancing the competing claims of the different stakeholders (Beauchamp and Bowie 1997). Two of the stakeholders that have an interest in the Council, i.e. the community and the environment, are discussed below.

The community in which the Council operates is its most important stakeholder. As the Council is a public organisation, no specific owners can be identified. The community is effectively acting in this role, and the owners of the Council are thus the people of Port Macquarie and Hastings. Complicating factor in the case of public organisations, such as Councils and utilities, is that most owners are also customers of that same organisation. The community is thus a stakeholder that embodies both the owners and the customers of the Council.

Corporations are characterised by a separation of ownership and control of operations. This characterisation is the genesis of the Agency Problem, which deals with the difficulty of effective corporate control to ensure that managers act in the best interest of the owners. Managers, who serve as agents for the owners, may not always work in the best interest of owners when control is separate from ownership (Bonazzi 2007).

Stakeholder theory effectively expands the realm of interest of the organisation to all stakeholders. The <em>Agency Problem </em>is thus also expanded as none of the stakeholders, including the community, have no direct control over decisions made by the Council. The case under consideration is an illustration of the Agency Problem. Mr Freeman has taken environment risk to obtain financial benefits to the detriment of the environmental, resulting in significant monetary damages. Mr Freedman thereby damaged the interests of the community, as the additional financial burden will negatively impact on the level of service the Council can provide.

Managers will optimise decisions only if appropriate incentives are given, clear limits of responsibility are defined, and activities are monitored (Bonazzi 2007). From the court proceedings, there is, however, no evidence that a comprehensive process for managing environmental risk was in place and the internal audit program did not include environmental risk (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009). After the initial court proceedings, the Council developed a comprehensive Project Management Framework and compliance with these requirements was added to the internal audit plan (Port Macquarie-Hastings Council 2007), thereby protecting the interests of the community. The Natural Environment is the second important stakeholder in this case. Although the natural environment is voiceless and can thus not express its preferences, it is embodied by lobby groups and environmental regulators. The environment is generally included as a stakeholder because of the recognition that it is an essential aspect of the long-term sustainability of corporations and society in general (Du Plessis et al. 2005). As discussed below, the standard ethical theory is anthropocentric and is as such, not able to account for the environment. This has created a situation where the environment is seen as a means to achieve financial objectives, resulting in its short-term exploitation.

Mr Freeman made an error in judgement in that he prioritised the short-term financial interests of the Council over the long-term interests of the environment. This is in line with the classical view of the firm in which all benefits are internalised, and the costs of actions are externalised (Beauchamp and Bowie 1997). In effect, the environment, embodied by the two threatened species, has paid the price for the financial gain anticipated by the Council. Governments have put environmental legislation in place to regulate the behaviour of managers, to counter the natural tendency of corporations to externalise the cost of their actions. It is clear from the court proceedings that Mr Freeman did not recognise the environment as a stakeholder with intrinsic value and it was only because of legislative pressures that the Council adopted a better way to mitigate environmental damage in future projects.

In summary, the stakeholder view of an organisation ensures that the no harm principle applies to all stakeholders, rather than only the owners. For activities with potential harm to the natural environment, it is essential to consider it as a stakeholder, represented by relevant legislation and interest groups.

<h2>Environmental Ethics for Managers and Deontic Constraints</h2>

From an ethical point of view, the Council has given priority to maximising the financial return of the land over its environmental value (Land &amp; Environment Court of New South Wales 2009: 74). To assess the moral implications of the Council<92>s actions, two ethical models (Brennan and Lo 2008) are applied to this case.

Consequential environmental ethics consider an action right or wrong by assessing the perceived consequences. In utilitarianism, the most widely used consequentialist theory, the outcome of an action is considered good if <91>utility<92>, i.e. pleasure or happiness, is maximised. For utilitarian environmental philosophers, such as Peter Singer (1979), this argument is extended to include animals. In other words, for an action to be ethical, the overall utility as a consequence of the action for all sentient beings needs to be maximised. However, utilitarianism is problematic as an ethical theory for environmental concerns (Brennan and Lo 2008). The environment does not only consist of humans and animals, but also of non-sentient entities such as plants, rivers and landscapes. Following the utilitarian strand of thought, these are not objects of moral concern as they cannot experience pleasure or pain and are thus of instrumental value to the satisfaction of sentient beings (Brennan and Lo 2008).

To determine whether the actions of the Council were ethical from a utilitarian point of view would require an extensive cost-benefit analysis, the so called Hedonistic Calculus, which lies outside the scope of this essay. What can be asserted is that the Council<92>s actions reduced the utility of the threatened species by destroying their natural habitat. Whether this has preference over the anticipated financial return anticipated through the new infrastructure is not immediately apparent.

Deontological theories consider whether an action is right or wrong irrespective of the consequences. Following Emmanuel Kant<92>s second formulation of the Categorical Imperative, humanity can never be used as a means to an end: <93>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your person or the person of any other, always at the same time as an end and never merely as a means to an end.<94> (Kennett and Townsend 1998: 75). In deontological environmental ethics, the anthropocentrism of the Categorical Imperative is expanded to include the environment (Brennan and Lo 2008). From a stakeholder theory perspective, every stakeholder, including the environment, has intrinsic value and a right not to be treated as a means to an end. This view is expressed in concepts such as product liability, industrial relations and environmental regulation (Beauchamp and Bowie 1997). A deontological environmental thinker could thus argue that the Council violated the intrinsic value of the two threatened species because they were used as a means to an end; as a means to obtain financial gain.

In summary, assessing this case from an ethical perspective confirms the importance of including the environment as a stakeholder with intrinsic value. This case illustrates that without this concept the environment can be used as a means to an end, as a means to increase the utility of the other stakeholders.

This case shows that using a stakeholder view of an organisation, as opposed to the classical view which gives preference to the owners, provides a better model to ensure all legal and moral obligations can be fulfilled. Furthermore, it is essential to recognise the natural environment as a stakeholder with equal intrinsic value equal to all other stakeholders. Assessing this case from an ethical perspective shows that the utilitarian point of view can lead to infinitely complex discussions about the utility of the consequences of each action the Council can undertake. How can the Council decide which values have precedence in this case? From a legal point of view, there is no issue as legislative powers have agreed to provide the threatened species with intrinsic preferential values over the anticipated financial gain. The principle nevertheless remains. Some organisations aim to alleviate this issue by using a Triple Bottom Line approach, in which financial, social and environmental values are compared. This inherently utilitarian point of view has, however, never been implemented to its fullest extent because there is no agreement between the relative value of environmental versus social and financial values (Norman and MacDonald 2004). In practical terms, what is the value of the survival chances of the Grass Owl and the Eastern Chestnut Mouse compared to the social and financial benefits of the road construction undertaken by Council? Regardless of the inherent issues with consequentialism, it is an intuitively appealing model that is widely used in decision-making processes.

The non-consequentialist deontological view offers a way to mitigate the issues inherent with utilitarianism. Although in practice a Triple Bottom Line analysis is required to come to decisions, the law acts as a deontic constraint to ensure that voiceless stakeholders, such as the environment, are provided with intrinsic value. This forces organisations to act dutifully to the environment and other stakeholders.

From a practical point of view, the managerial impact of this case is that senior managers can be held personally accountable and that they need to consider the environment as a stakeholder with intrinsic value. Not being an expert in the issue at hand is not accepted as a reasonable defence (Thomas 2009). Being aware of environmental issues is not sufficient and taking active steps to implement a robust Environmental Management System is the best risk management approach (Blake Dawson 2009; Thomas 2009). Most Australian states and territories maintain environmental laws which effectively deem certain corporate officers to be guilty of offences which their corporate officers commit (Thomas 2009). These laws are necessary to ensure that corporations and public organisations appropriately assign value to the environment over anticipated financial gains and other perceived internalised benefits. One mechanism to control environmental risk, used by many organisations around the world, is ISO 14001:2007 Environmental Management Systems. This international benchmark defines standards for management commitment to ensure that directors and senior managers are aware of and actively involved in mitigating environmental risk (Maharaj and Ramnath 2005). The risk of habitat destruction would have been recognised and mitigated had the Council implemented such a system before undertaking the road construction works.

2242,strategic-management-and-business-performance,Strategic Management and Business Performance,"A considerable amount of research has been devoted to establishing a relationship between <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tag/business-strategy/"">strategic management</a> and business performance. The spectrum of conclusions ranges from strong positive correlations to claims that the role of formal planning systems in business management is only informational (Rogers, Miller &amp; Judge 1999, 567<96>568). Hill, Jones &amp; Galvin (2004, 23) take a position in this debate by claiming that ""strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance"".

This claim further referred to as the 'Performance Claim', is based on research conducted by Miller &amp; Cardinal (1994) and Rogers et al. (1999). Many academics question the usefulness of formal strategic planning systems as a means to improve company performance and argue that <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-management-and-serendipity/"">serendipity</a> plays a critical role in determining competitive advantage (Mintzberg 1979, Hart 1992, Hamel 1996).

This essay evaluates the claim that strategic planning has a positive influence on company performance. This paper argues that an organisation can not rely solely on formal systems to develop a corporate strategy. Although empirical research points towards a positive correlation between strategic planning and company performance, these studies suffer from some methodological problems.

It will further be argued that because strategic management is not an exact science, strategy formulation requires a great deal of intuition and company performance relies to some extent on serendipity. This finding does, however, not imply that strategic planning as a formal exercise is futile. Strategic planning is vital for excellent management of an organisation. Not as a means to plot the course for years ahead, but as a way to be able to anticipate the unpredictability of external influences.

In the next section of this essay, the terms of the performance claim will be clarified. Following a discussion of research supporting and rejecting the Performance Claim, the different viewpoints are analysed and, an integrated approach to strategic planning will be proposed.

<h2>Strategic Management and Business Performance</h2>

The Performance Claim (Strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance) has two terms that need clarification before it can be assessed: strategic planning and company performance.

<h3>What is strategic planning?</h3>

Hill et al. (2004, 5) define strategy regarding its function as: ""an action a company takes to attain superior performance"". Functional definitions are, however, not suitable to assess the Performance Claim. When a strategy is defined as the action(s) taken to improve performance, the claim that strategy enhances performance becomes a tautology (Actions taken to attain superior performance, on average, have a positive impact on company performance). A different kind of definition is required to assess the Performance Claim.

Mintzberg (1979, 11) argued that strategic planning is a multifaceted phenomenon which is impossible to define in a short essential definition. He rejects any interpretation of strategy that restricts it to explicit, a priori guidelines and expands restrictive definitions by including evolved, a posteriori, consistencies in decisional behaviour as a strategy. Mintzberg advocates a phenomenological approach and defines strategy as a ""plan, ploy, pattern, position and perspective"" (Mintzberg 1987).

The multifaceted approach of Mintzberg is more suitable to assess the Performance Claim because it explains what strategic management is or can be, not what it is intended to do. Strategic planning is the formal process, or set of processes used to determine the strategies (actions) of the organisation (Hill et al. 2004, 5). Not all strategy is, however, derived from a formalised process. Hill et al. (2004, 23) distinguish, following Mintzberg, between intended strategy and emergent strategy. In intended strategy<97>the formal strategic planning process<97>strategic choices are based on rigorous analysis of external and internal factors.

Emergent strategies, on the other hand, originate from organisational grassroots. Emergent strategies are not developed but evolve in an organisation through actions that the organisation takes in reaction to internal and external circumstances (Hill et al. 2004, 20). The discourse around the Performance Claim focuses on the impact on the performance of strategic planning as a formalised process. In this essay, the Performance Claim will be evaluated from both perspectives.

<h3>Company performance</h3>

Company performance is traditionally related to increasing shareholder value. Performance can, however, also be measured regarding reduction of environmental footprint, improved occupational health and safety performance, increased customer satisfaction and so on. All research referred to in this essay uses the restricted interpretation of company performance, e.g. financial performance.

A key term in the Performance Claim is that company performance is on average positively affected by formal strategic planning. The research referred to in this essay (Miller &amp; Cardinal 1994, Rogers et al. 1999) investigated whether a positive correlation between the amount of strategic planning and company performance exists; the more formal strategic planning, the better a company will perform.

<h2>The Performance Claim</h2>

The Performance Claim states that there exists a positive correlation between the extent of formal strategic planning and financial company performance.

Miller &amp; Cardinal (1994) argue that strategic planning positively influences financial performance of an organisation. They investigated how firm size, capital intensity and environmental turbulence influence performance in firms with different degrees of formal strategic planning. The authors concluded that the mean correlations support the thesis that planning positively affects growth and profitability. The correlations show a fairly large fluctuation (0.30 &lt; r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.71), but are skewed towards positive performance. They also concluded that stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent environments (Miller &amp; Vaughan 2001, 1658).

Rogers et al. (1999) argued that a direct link between strategic planning and performance could not be made without considering the moderating effect of the actual content of the strategy. They investigated whether the relationship between strategic planning processes and organisational performance depends on the content of the strategy pursued and not just the extent of planning. Strategic planning was measured by using a questionnaire completed by representatives of several banks, which resulted in a set of planning dimensions: accounting control, integration &amp; coordination, flexibility, goals &amp; plans, scanning and broad analysis. When the data was controlled to include strategy content, it was found that strategy content moderates the relationship between planning and performance. The overall conclusion of their research was that formal strategic planning positively influences company performance, as expressed in the Performance Claim.

Mankins &amp; Steele (2005) support the Performance Claim but argue that companies typically only realise 63% of the potential value of their strategy because of defects in planning and execution. Mankins and Steele provide a list of causes of performance loss but do not recognise that contingencies can negatively influence company performance. They thus imply that any strategy can be realised, as long as planned and executed appropriately.

<h3>Emergent Strategy and company performance</h3>

Several researchers emphasise the importance of emergent strategy formulation and downplay the role of formal strategic planning. They argue that luck plays a critical role in whether an organisation is successful or not (Mintzberg 1979, Hart 1992, Hamel 1996).

Strategy formation is, according to Mintzberg, the interplay between the formal, intended strategies and informal, emergent strategies, mediated by leadership (Mintzberg 1979, 72). He emphasises that strategy is not a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at prearranged times at the will of management (Mintzberg 1979, 84). Mintzberg emphasises the unpredictability of the external environment. An organisation can find itself in a stable environment for long periods of time, without the need to change its strategy. Sometimes the environment can, however, become so turbulent that even the best planning techniques are useless because of the high level of unpredictability (Mintzberg 1979, 75). This seems to contradict the finding of Rogers et al. (1999) that stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent environments. Companies that perform well in a chaotic environment acknowledge that circumstances are in eternal flux. Both Rogers and Mintzberg are correct, the world is unpredictable, but proper strategic planning includes provisions for this uncertainty, such as scenario planning (Hill et al. 2004, 23).

Hamel (1996) argues that strategic planning as it is practised in business management is not strategic at all. He claims that strategy development tends to be a reductionist process, based on simple rules and heuristics, working from the present to the future, rather than the other way around. The strategic planning process is mostly extrapolative, and it is assumed that the future will resemble the past, an assumption that David Hume has shown to be irrational more than 250 years ago (Prevos 2005). Hamel emphasises the creative aspect of strategic management and points out that it is not a rote process that can be instrumentalised in neat systems, but a quest that must be a subversive revolution to improve company performance (Hamel 1996, 71).

<h3>An integrated approach</h3>

Hill et al. (2004, 130) argue that, although luck may be a reason for an organisation's success in particular cases, it is an unconvincing explanation for the persistent success of a company. They find it ""difficult to imagine how sustained excellence <em><85></em> could result from anything other than a conscious effort"" (Hill et al. 2004, 130). There are, however, many examples of how luck has positively influenced the future of organisations dramatically, and vice versa how unpredictable external circumstances have negatively influenced an organisation's fortune.

Empirical research shows a positive correlation between the extent of formal strategic planning and company performance (Miller &amp; Cardinal 1994, Rogers et al. 1999). This research does, however, not prove a causal link between strategic planning and company performance. From an evolutionary perspective, only those companies that maintain a positive performance will survive. The research did not include an analysis of failed companies and their strategic planning. Furthermore, the research focusses on realised strategies. Mintzberg argues in this context that achieved strategy is always a combination of intended and emergent strategies (Mintzberg 1979, Mintzberg 1987). Following Mintzberg's typology of strategy formulation, the positive correlation between strategic planning and performance is not only based on formal, intended, strategy. Emergent strategy, and thus serendipity, luck and informal strategy formulation, play an essential role in achieving positive performance. This concept also explains the seeming contradiction between Rogers and Mintzberg regarding the influence of turbulence. Hill et al. (2004, 21) recognise the mutual importance of intended and emergent strategy and stress that management needs to understand the process of emergence and intervene when appropriate. Even though these strategies evolve without going through the formal process, management needs to evaluate these and select those that align with the vision set for the organisation.

Hart (1992) summarises the discourse between proponents of strict formal planning and those that stress the limits of this approach. He refers to formal planning as the rational model for strategy formulation. The rational model advocates to consider all available alternatives, identify and evaluate all of the consequences of each option and then select the preferred alternative. Researchers challenging this approach argue that organisations can achieve only limited rationality because of individual cognitive limits, heuristics and biases in human judgement.

Hart proposes an integrated approach to strategy formulation. Hart argues that prior literature on the subject has focused on a particular theme and has failed to capture the full range of the phenomenon of strategic planning.

An integrated approach to strategic management is required to get the full benefits. Strategic planning will not automatically positively influence performance once put into place; it requires constant ""tinkering and kludging"" to deal with continually changing circumstances.

<h3>Strategic management as a science</h3>

Research into strategy formulation has resulted in a plethora of strategic management theories. The fundamental differences between individual approaches and the fact that they come and go in quick succession support the claim that there is no firm scientific basis for theories of management (Miller &amp; Vaughan 2001, 5).

Strategic management theory is an eclectic field with contributions from military history, engineering, industrial economics, organisational sociology, behavioural, cognitive and social psychology, anthropology and political science (Foster &amp; Browne 1996, 21). Strategic management is thus more aligned with social sciences than the exact sciences and as such needs a methodology to suit the unpredictability of human behaviour, rather than a rational model, feigning predictability.

Management deals with human beings and their social interaction and both the external and internal environment are in a constant state of flux. A strategy will only improve performance if its formulation takes the fundamental unpredictability of the world into account. Strategy cannot be formulated through rational systems that model the real world. Formulating strategy is a continuously developing narrative between the organisation and the external environment.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

In this essay, the question of whether strategic planning has, on average, a positive impact on company performance has been investigated. It has been argued that this is indeed the case, but a business can not rely on formal strategy planning alone to affect performance positively.

Although research (Miller &amp; Cardinal 1994, Rogers et al. 1999) has established a positive correlation between strategic planning and company performance, it has not found a causal relationship between formal strategic planning and improved company performance. Strategy formulation is a complex synergy of intended and emergent strategy, and positive company performance is brought about by a combination of both.

It has also been argued that strategic management as science is closely related to social sciences and that the methodology of strategy formulation needs to fit the nature of the discipline. This idea does not mean that strategic planning is a futile exercise. Even in uncharted waters, a course needs to be chosen, even if there are no reference points for orientation. Strategic planning is vital for ensuring continued good company performance. Only those organisations that practice some form of strategic planning will survive. Not strategy as a rational model to plot the course for years ahead, but as a narrative between the organisation and the external environment, anticipating the unpredictability of external influences.

But what is strategy and does it improve business performance? This essay examines the relationship between strategic management and serendipity in light of strategic management studies.

Life is characterised by serendipity, and much of human culture is, in essence, a means to deal with the unpredictable. We can not know whether the next harvest will fail, whether we still have a job next year or whether we will die. Ancient systems, such as astrology and other forms of divination were developed to reduce uncertainty in people's lives. After the era of enlightenment, divination was replaced by science, and we now rely on weather forecasters, medical professionals, engineers and other professionals to provide information to help us plan our lives.

What is valid for life, in general, is also adequate for managing an organisation. An organisation is a group of people that are bound together through a common goal. To increase the likelihood that organisations achieve objectives, they require management, i.e. actions of members of the organisation aimed at reducing uncertainty. One of the most significant uncertainties in business is the existence of competitors and their intrinsic unpredictable actions. Strategic management is a specific kind of management that seeks to reduce this uncertainty.

<h2>Strategic Management Schools of Thought</h2>

The distinction between prescriptive theories, such as those propounded by Igor Ansoff and Michael Porter, and descriptive schools of strategic thinking are discussed. It is argued that an organisation can not rely solely on formal, prescriptive systems to develop and implement strategy and that an integrated approach is required to act strategically and increase the chances of success.

Socially constructed phenomena, such as religion, culture and management are notoriously hard to define. This fact is undoubtedly the case for business strategy, and although many scholars have applied their intellect to this problem, no consensus has thus far emerged (Forster and Browne 1996; Mintzberg 1987). The most productive approach has been to move away from essentialist <93>strategy is <85><94> type definitions that attempt to capture strategy in one quintessential sentence. Mintzberg (1987) criticises the reductionist approach to strategy definition by comparing it with a group of blind scientists describing an elephant by touch alone. One says it is a trunk, the other might focus on the legs, but nobody is able is to describe the elephant as a whole. To circumvent perceived issues with essentialist definitions, a phenomenological view, characterising different perspectives of strategic thinking in a model or taxonomy is preferred.

Several authors have proposed systems to classify strategic approaches for business. For example, Igor Ansoff (1987) defined a matrix of four generic strategies and Michael Porter (1980) described three generic strategies to achieve competitive advantage.

Igor Ansoff, often credited as the Father of Strategic Management, started his career as a mathematician and later moved into the field of management (Hussey 1999). Mintzberg credits Ansoff as being instrumental in the development of the Planning School (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999). Being trained as a mathematician, it is not surprising that Ansoff's strategic thinking revolved around structure and order. The subtitle of the first edition of Corporate Strategy was <93>An analytic approach to business policy for growth and expansion<94> (Ansoff 1987). The process of strategy formulation is, according to Ansoff, not a creative activity but a formal one, consisting of distinct steps supported by checklists and other control techniques (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999). Ansoff published a great deal on turbulent and discontinuous change (Hussey 1999). But Ansoff, thinking like a mathematician, sought to control the unpredictability of the external environment with checklists, budgets and operating plans. The reality he thus tried to control is, however, not physical and predictable, but social and therefore less likely to be controllable through analytic means.

Almost two decades after Ansoff published his first ideas on strategic management, Michael Porter came on the scene and quickly attained the status of management guru. In his book Competitive Strategies, Porter (1980) argues that only three strategies exist which provide opportunities for success. The differences between these strategies are in the strategic advantage sought from either cost or differentiation and the target aimed at (Speed 1989). Mintzberg and Lampel (1999) place the work of Porter in the Positioning School, a prescriptive view on strategy popular in the 1980s. In Porter's view, a strategy can be reduced to a generic position taking based on a formal analysis of the external environment. Because of the intuitive appeal of Porter's work, it quickly picked up by management consultants, who proclaimed it to be a scientific truth (Mintzberg and Lampel 1999). One often heard criticism of Porter's work is, however, that it lacks empirical support, using selective case studies to make his point (Speed 1989).

Henry Mintzberg employs a more philosophical approach when he classifies strategic business thinking in ten Schools of Thought (Table 1), which he describes in their historical and ideological context. Early theorists, such as Igor Ansoff, focused on the analytical aspects of strategy formation. The first three schools in Mintzberg's taxonomy are therefore prescriptive and focus on how strategy ought to be formulated. One of the major premises of the prescriptive schools is the Performance Claim, which states that the more an organisation engages in systematic strategic planning, the more likely it will result in above average returns. The prescriptive schools have been influential in the discourse of strategy formulation, but have failed to explain the process of strategy execution (Mintzberg 1990).

[table id=4 /]

Later developments in strategic management literature moved away from the prescriptive approaches modelled on the quantitative sciences and their inherent presumption of a controllable world. The descriptive schools of thought are inspired by the qualitative social and cultural sciences and study what businesses did to be successful for other organisations to learn from their approaches. The descriptive schools move from a focus on apriori strategic planning to a-posteriori dynamic strategy formulation and execution.

For practitioners, the prescriptive schools of thought are desirable, illustrated by the ubiquity of tools such as SWOT analysis and generic strategies, such as those developed by Ansoff (1987) and Porter (1980). The descriptive schools are somewhat problematic for practitioners of strategic management because they do not provide straightforward recipes for success. Analogous to the Naturalistic Fallacy in moral philosophy, where an ought cannot be derived from an is, the descriptive schools (strategy as an is) are not very suitable for managers to determine what strategic decision ought to be made. The question raised by Mintzberg's taxonomy of strategic thought and other similar taxonomies is how average practitioners can decide which strategy they should employ.

<h2>Strategic Management and Serendipity</h2>

One of the major premises of the prescriptive schools of strategic management thought is the Performance Claim, which can be formally expressed as (Hill et al. 2004: 23):

<blockquote>Strategic planning, on average, has a positive impact on company performance.</blockquote>

Miller and Cardinal (1994) investigated how firm size, capital intensity and environmental turbulence influences performance in firms with different degrees of formal strategic planning. They found that correlations between planning and business results show a relatively large fluctuation (-0.30 &lt; r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.71), but are skewed towards positive performance. They also concluded that stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent environments (Miller and Cardinal 1994). Rogers et al. (1999) investigated whether the relationship between strategic planning processes and organisational performance depends on the content of the strategy pursued and not just the extent of planning. They concluded that formal strategic planning positively influences company performance, as expressed in the Performance Claim. Miller and Cardinal (1994) also support the Performance Claim but argue that companies typically only realise 63% of the potential value of their strategy because of defects in planning and execution. They provide a list of possible causes of performance loss but do not seem to recognise that unpredictable events can negatively influence performance and imply that any strategy can be realised, as long as planned and executed appropriately.

However, some academics question the idea that formal strategic planning systems are a sufficient condition to improve company performance and argue that luck and serendipity play a critical role in determining competitive advantage (Mintzberg 1979; Hart 1992; Hamel 1996). This criticism is supported by the fact that that the prescriptive view of strategy formation contains a logical inconsistency. In prescriptive schools, a strategy is often defined as the actions a company takes to attain superior performance (Hill et al. 2004). However, when a strategy is thus defined, the Performance Claim becomes a tautology:

<blockquote>Actions taken to attain superior performance, on average, have a positive impact on company performance.</blockquote>

Another issue with prescriptive schools of thought is the presumed causality from plan to action to succeed. The definition of strategy discussed above expresses an intent (<93>Actions taken to attain <85><94>). This intent does, however, not imply a causal link between planning action and success. Hamel (1996) argues that strategic planning, as practised in business management, is not strategic at all. He claims that strategy development tends to be a reductionist process, based on simple rules and heuristics, working from the present to the future, rather than the other way around. The strategic planning process is largely extrapolative, and it is assumed that the future will resemble the past, an assumption that <a href=""https://prevos.net/humanities/philosophy/induction/"">David Hume has shown to be irrational</a>. Hamel, therefore, emphasises the creative aspects of strategic management and points out that it is not a rote process that can be instrumentalised in neat systems, such as SWOT diagrams and generic strategies. A strategy is in the view of Hamel (1996: 71) a <93>quest that must be a subversive revolution to improve company performance<94>.

Logical analysis of the principles of the prescriptive schools of strategic thought shows them to be invalid because the Performance Claim is tautological. However, the empirical fact of the Performance Claim holds at least some truth remains. This seeming contradiction emerges because the relationship between planning and organisational success is more complicated than was assumed in the research. Firstly, the analysis only used companies still in existence, leaving out those that did employ strategic planning but failed. Secondly, without conducting fully controlled studies, it is near impossible to prove causality between planning and success. A positive correlation does not imply that planning is the cause of a good business result.

Hart (1992) summarises the discourse between proponents of strict formal planning and those that stress the limits of this approach. He refers to formal planning as the rational model for strategy formulation. The rational model advocates to consider all available alternatives, identify and evaluate all of the consequences of each alternative and then select the preferred choice. Researchers challenging this approach argue that organisations can achieve only limited rationality because of individual cognitive limits, heuristics and biases in human judgement (Forster and Browne 1996).

The process of strategy formation is, according to Mintzberg (1979), the interplay between the formal intended strategies and informal emergent strategies, mediated by leadership. What he emphasises is that strategy is not a fixed plan, nor does it change systematically at prearranged times at the will of management. Mintzberg also emphasises the unpredictability of the external environment. An organisation can find itself in a stable environment for long periods of time, without the need to change its strategy. Sometimes the environment can, however, become so turbulent that even the best planning techniques are useless because of the high level of unpredictability (Mintzberg 1979). This seems to contradict the finding of Miller and Cardinal (1994) that stronger planning-profitability correlations emerge when firms face turbulent environments. This is not unexpected as those companies that succumbed to the turbulent environment were not included in the research. This leaves the question of whether to follow prescriptive or descriptive schools of thought open. The most productive answer is that strategic management is a complex synergy of apriori intended and a-posteriori emergent strategy and positive company performance are brought about by a combination of both. Thus, although formal planning is not a sufficient condition to obtain superior company performance, it is most certainly a necessary condition.

Research into strategy formulation has resulted in a plethora of strategic management theories. The fundamental differences between individual theories and the fact that they come and go in quick succession support the claim that there is no firm scientific basis for theories of management (Miller and Cardinal 1994). Strategic management theory is an eclectic field with contributions from military history, engineering, industrial economics, organisational sociology, behavioural, cognitive and social psychology, anthropology and political science (Forster and Browne 1996). Strategic management is thus more aligned with social sciences than the exact sciences and as such needs a methodology that suits the unpredictability of human behaviour, rather than a rational model, feigning predictability.

Management deals with human beings and their social interaction and both the external and internal environment are in a constant state of flux. A strategy will only improve performance if its formulation takes the fundamental unpredictability of the world into account. A strategy cannot be formulated through rational systems that model the real world. Formulating strategy is a continuously developing narrative between the organisation and the external environment.

Strategic planning as a means to reduce uncertainty in organisations is a young science in which many different perspectives have been explored. Following a taxonomy based on descriptive and prescriptive strategic management, it has been shown that a formal planning approach by itself can not cause a company to achieve above-average returns.

Although empirical research points towards a positive correlation between strategic planning and company performance, these studies suffer from methodological problems. This problem does, however, not imply that strategic planning as a formal exercise is futile. Formal strategic planning is vital for prudent management. Not as a means to define the course for years ahead, but as a way to be able to anticipate the unpredictability of external influences.

4106,water-privatisation,Water Privatisation and its effects on Customer Satisfaction,"The supply of water and sanitation in urban areas has historically been dominated by public investments. Aqueducts in ancient Rome and other major cities in the empire we funded by public money. In nineteenth-century London, it took a considerable public investment in a sewer system to rid the city of the 200,000 cesspools that were the cause of many diseases that plagued the city (Cadbury 2003).

These developments eventually led to the establishment of fully vertically integrated government-owned monopolies in water and sanitation services. These monopolistic service providers have repeatedly been criticised for being inefficient and lacking <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/balanced-centricity/"">customer focus</a> (Deichmann and Lall 2007). The past two decades, there has been a gradual transition of ownership of utility companies, particularly communications, transport and energy, from public to private ownership. Private corporations are now actors in about half the countries of the world in some fundamental dimension of service delivery in the utility sector. This trend is increasing and is currently extending to the water and sanitation sectors (Estache et al. 2005).

In this paper, the rationale behind the recent wave of water privatisation in water and sanitation service provision, with particular reference to its effects on service quality, is discussed. The water and sanitation supply chain are examined to determine likely points of entry for competitive privatisation. It is proposed that the provision of retail services is an area in which market forces can be used to improve service to customers. A review of effects of privatisation on service quality is presented, based on extant literature on the topic and literature on service marketing theory. A conceptual model is presented to facilitate further research on the mechanisms that influence customer satisfaction due to ownership structure. It is argued that <em>managerial behaviour</em> is dependent upon ownership structure and a major determinant of the level of service quality.

<h2>The Case for Water Privatisation</h2>

One of the often cited reasons that water distribution networks are in public control is because they are considered a natural monopoly (DiLorenzo 1996). A natural monopoly occurs when, ""due to the economies of scale of a particular industry, the maximum efficiency of production and distribution is realised through a single supplier"" (DiLorenzo 1996: 43). The high level of investment required to construct water distribution and sanitation networks creates a natural barrier to entry for more than one firm to operate in the same geographic area. Natural monopolies are considered unsuitable for a competitive market because of the duplication of facilities required to service individual customers in the same area (Hart et al. 1997). Natural monopolies exist in most markets for networked services, such as telecommunication, transport (particularly rail and harbours), electricity, gas and water supply (DiLorenzo 1996).

<blockquote><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/milton-friedman-corporate-social-responsibility/"">Milton Friedman</a>: ""The most important single central fact about free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit.""</blockquote>

Natural monopolies in water and sanitation services are also widespread because of the so-called diamond-water paradox, expressed by Adam Smith as the <em>Paradox of Value</em> (Robertson and Taylor 1957). This is the assertion that some commodities without value in use, such as diamonds, have a high value in exchange and vice versa, water has a high use value, but demands a low price (Levy 1982). Although water is more critical to survival than diamonds, this is not reflected in pricing. Water is used for many purposes and in the case of reticulated water supply, the same water is used for drinking, hygiene, gardens and as a transport medium for waste. Economic theory suggests that the price of a product is determined by its marginal utility, i.e. its least important use to a person (Levy 1982). In the case of water, this is reflected in the difference in price between tap water and bottled water. Consumers in Australia are willing to pay more than 1000 times the price of tap water for a bottle of drinking water, although the quality is essentially the same. The low value of reticulated water implies that providing this type of service generates very low margins for the investor. Significant amounts of assets are required to deliver this service to a customer, but the price that can be commanded is very little. This makes reticulated water and sanitation supply particularly economically uninteresting for private suppliers and is thus dominated by monopolistic publicly owned service providers.

Because of the natural monopoly characteristics of water and sanitation services, privatisation has seen some monopolistic segments in the industry transferred to private operators (Estache et al. 2005). One means by which governments attempt to negate the disadvantages of monopolised state-owned service providers is through regulation. Regulation usually takes the form of market mimicking regimes in which service providers compete with each other through performance benchmarking. In this system, utilities are ""forced to compete with a shadow-firm whose performance is determined by average or best practice in the industry"" (Braadbaart 2007: 680). Research in the Netherlands shows that this type of benchmarking enhances economic performance. There is a clear case for yardstick competition (Estache et al. 2005; Tupper and Resende 2004). Yardstick competition is, however, not a sine qua non for performance enhancement. Also, collaborative rather than competitive, benchmarking has a positive effect on utility performance (Braadbaart 2007). Regulation is appropriate if firms have incentives to reduce costs and minimise the level of service provision. The incentive to reduce cost is considered a potential negative consequence of privatisation (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Partly privatised utilities subject to service quality regulation maintain incentives towards high levels of quality (Fumagalli et al. 2007).

<h3>Status of Water privatisation in the World</h3>

Most water and sanitation service are currently provided by publicly owned organisations (Deichmann and Lall 2007; Estache et al. 2005). However, in several countries around the world different modes and levels of privatisation of water and sanitation services have been implemented. The privatisation of state-owned utility service providers has been most prominent in developing countries because the opportunity cost of maintaining government-owned enterprises over private ownership is higher than in developed countries (Deichmann and Lall 2007).

The privatisation of state-owned utility providers is partially driven by the World Bank. The privatisation conditions of reforms funded by the World Bank is the privatisation of formerly state-owned enterprises (Tsamenyi et al. 2008). Water privatisation is, however, a broad sweeping term that can encompass a range of different models in different parts of the supply chain, which is discussed in more detail below. Broadly speaking, privatisation is part of the supply chain of water and sanitation supply in around 35% of the countries of the developed world and 80% of the countries in the developing world.

Estimates show that nearly half of the urban population in African nations rely on private providers for water service (Auriol and Picard 2008). Research on the efficiency of private operators in this continent shows that they are more cost-efficient and that corruption reduces efficiency and matters more than ownership. However, no significant difference between public and private operators is found once environmental factors have been accounted for (Estache et al. 2005).

In 1989, Argentina initiated a process of privatising infrastructure services, including water and sanitation (Chisari et al. 1999). Services were privatised because of a need to alleviate the fiscal burden imposed by public utilities. Before services were privatised, the existing organisations were vertically disintegrated. In the water sector, competition has been introduced through a bidding process. Between 1993 and 1994, privatisation of water distribution resulted in a 4.9% reduction in inputs purchased as a share of total sales. The size of population served per staff member decreased by 27.6%, i.e. the total number of employees increased. Water efficiency, measured as distribution losses, improved over this period. Lastly, the cost of water to consumers grew by 5.5 %. Overall, privatisation of utilities in Argentina has increased labour productivity, but higher cost for customers, while lowering cost for the utility providers (Chisari et al. 1999). In Brazil, it was found that there is no significant difference between public and private operators regarding their productivity (Estache et al. 2005).

In 1989, the government sold ten publicly owned water/sanitation companies in England and Wales and established a new, independent sector regulator (van den Berg 1997). The regulator controls both water and sanitation utilities with the aim to protect customers' interests (Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. 2004).
Water and sanitation service provision in the Australian state of Victoria is fully in public hands, with many activities outsourced to private partners. All state-owned service providers are regulated by the Essential Services Commission. The Victorian government is currently investigating means to increase private participation in the provision of water and sanitation services through so-called Third Party Access (Essential Services Commission 2009).

<h2>General Arguments for Water Privatisation</h2>

The public ownership model has been criticised because of a perception that services provided by these institutions are often inadequate and few utilities are able to recover full cost as pricing is often politically motivated (Deichmann and Lall 2007). The general argument against public ownership of utility service providers is that public services lack Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' to guide resource allocation based on consumer preferences (Andreassen 1994). The regulator for water and sewerage services in Victoria, Australia has expressed the anticipated advantages of privatisation succinctly (Essential Services Commission 2009: 9, emphasis added):

<ul>
    <li>More efficient allocation of resources (allocative efficiency);</li>
    <li>Efficiency and productivity improvements, leading to lower costs of providing products and/or services from existing input sources, processes and technologies (productive efficiency);</li>
    <li>Longer term efficiency and productivity improvements, with lower costs and improved service quality arising from new and improved input sources, processes and technologies (dynamic efficiency) and;</li>
    <li>Greater customer choice, with innovative offerings of products and/or services that better reflect customer needs and preferences.</li>
</ul>

DiLorenzo (1996) argues that the often proclaimed natural monopolies in utility service provision are an economic fiction and their development was an ex-post rationale for government intervention. There is, according to DiLorenzo (1996), no evidence that a natural monopoly, i.e. one firm achieving lower long-run average total cost than other companies, in the industry thereby establishing a permanent monopoly, ever existed. The existence of economies of scale in water and other public utilities does not necessitate a monopoly because competitive and market forces will naturally regulate an industry (DiLorenzo 1996).

Hart et al. (1997) point out that private suppliers deliver public services at a lower cost than public providers. Public ownership of utilities is generally viewed as generating inefficiencies because of soft budget constraints as governments will subsidise money-losing ventures. Empirical data from the United States shows that publicly owned water utilities had higher costs than their privately owned counterparts (Estache and Rossi 2002). The transfer from public to private ownership is thus often advocated as a solution for the poor economic performance of utility companies (Auriol and Picard 2008). The economic arguments over efficiency in relation to ownership are, however, not conclusive as some research indicates that there are no statistically significant differences in efficiency between water corporations, regardless of their ownership structure (Bakker 2007; Estache and Rossi 2002).

Economic theory suggests that a privately owned monopolist will over-invest in cost reduction if the quality of their service is not regulated (Hart et al. 1997). This decrease in investment can have negative consequences on service quality as investment and service quality are closely related to the provision of utilities. Although it can be shown that both private and public monopolists are equally likely to under-invest in quality enhancements, publicly owned utility providers will deliver a higher quality because there is no managerial incentive to reduce cost (Fumagalli et al. 2007; Hart et al. 1997). The case for government-owned service provision is generally stronger when cost reductions are likely to reduce service quality, when quality innovations are unimportant, and when corruption in government procurement is a severe problem (Hart et al. 1997). In contrast, the case for water privatisation is stronger when quality reducing cost reductions can be controlled through regulation or by competition (Hart et al. 1997).

Initiatives to privatise state-owned enterprises are often based on the assumption that in private industry, managers have greater freedom to set a corporate strategy and raise capital as is the case in publicly owned organisations (Andreassen 1994; Fumagalli et al. 2007). Water corporations require incentives to act in the public interest and to ensure that managerial behaviour is disciplined. These incentives can be provided through the introduction of competition (Andreassen 1994; Deichmann and Lall 2007; Fumagalli et al. 2007).

Services delivered by publicly owned institutions are often considered inadequate, few utilities are able to recover full cost and pricing is politically motivated (Deichmann and Lall 2007). One of the main issues identified by proponents of increased private business involvement in the provision of utilities is that publicly owned services are not subject to market forces (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Porter (1990) claims on a macroeconomic level that corporate strategy, industry structure and rivalry and demanding customers will stimulate service providers to focus on the market.

To offer a high level of utility, the public sector must be more marketed oriented, i.e. supply more differentiated services (Andreassen 1994). Privatised energy companies are improving their market position by being more customer oriented and focusing on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-branding/"">branding</a> in response to increased competition (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007). The principal objective of a Marketing Orientation is to provide a long-term profit focus through three behavioural components (Narver and Slater 1990):

<ul>
    <li>Customer orientation: Understanding customer's needs to be able to create superior value;</li>
    <li>Competitor orientation: Understanding the short and long-term strengths and weaknesses of competitors; and</li>
    <li>Interfunctional coordination: Leveraging collective resources to create value.</li>
</ul>

There has been strong opposition to the introduction of market forces in water supply. The main argument being that water should be considered a human right and not as a tradeable commodity. Water is regarded as a human right as it is not substitutable and intrinsically linked with other human rights, such as the right to life (Bakker 2007). These arguments do, however, not preclude commercialisation of water supply services because many other human rights are underpinned also by private business involvement, e.g. the right to life and the food industry. Another line of thought used to argue against commercial influences in the supply of water is environmentally grounded.

Private companies are answerable to shareholders that seek profit maximisation and will thus not be able to provide long-term sustainable water supply solutions (Bakker 2007). However, market forces in water service provision use the scarcity of water as a starting point and enforce that it must be priced at full economic and environmental cost, rather than political pricing adopted in many jurisdictions. Using market pricing will ensure that water is allocated to its highest value use (Bakker 2007).

<h3>Types of Water Privatisation</h3>

There are many levels at which participation of privately owned industry can be achieved. Bakker (2007) identified three categories of resource management reform and seven possible means to achieve this. Property rights can be privatised in the form of riparian rights or the sale of water supply infrastructure to the private sector. Deregulation can occur where, for example, the state ceases direct control over water quality mechanisms (Bakker 2007). Organisational types of reform opportunities exist in using private sector partnerships, where governments purchase a service instead of an asset (Auriol and Picard 2008). The corporatisation of organisational structures is the conversion of the business model from a local government to a publicly owned corporation. The governance of resources can be reformed by marketisation through the introduction of a water market and commercialisation through the introduction of commercial principles in water management. Lastly, (Bakker 2007) proposes decentralisation and the subsequent introduction of community managed utility services as a reform option. All these types of water privatisation can occur at multiple places in the supply chain of water and sanitation services.

<h2>The Water and Sanitation Service Supply Value Chain</h2>

The supply of water and sanitation services has a circular supply chain that is deeply connected with the natural environment (Figure 3.1). Water is mostly sourced from rivers, groundwater, or more increasingly, seawater. The so-called 'raw water' can be distributed directly to customers or treated to a higher level of quality, depending on customer preferences. The sanitation supply chain starts with the collection and transportation of wastewater from customers. The wastewater is treated to a suitable standard and either reincorporated in the natural water cycle or sold to other customers (Figure 3.1). All these activities typically occur within a single organisation with the supply chain only being interrupted by the brief time that the water is being used at the customer's property. The water and sanitation industry particularly, where government-owned, is an example of complete vertical integration. In most cases, water is harvested or created, stored, treated, transported and retailed without the intervention or involvement of external parties.

The supply chain for water and sanitation has some characteristics in common with that of agricultural commodities. Both water and agricultural commodities are harvested at particular times throughout the year that does not necessarily match up with the demands patterns of customers. The weather also plays a critical role in determining the total yield of the harvest. The product must be stored so that demand and supply can be matched. In agriculture, the commodity is stored in silos, and in the water industry, it is stored in tanks, dams, the reticulation network and aquifers.

There is a significant difference between agriculture and water supply chains in the mechanism used to meet consumer demand from the point of storage. Agricultural commodities are shifted in discrete units or bundles via road, rail and marine transport. Water is most commonly supplied continuously to the customer via pipework directly into the customer's house. The service is provided on demand, with no need for order placing or direct intervention from the service provider. The supply chain for water services is entirely dissimilar to other networked utilities, such as electricity or telecommunications in which supply must always equal demand due to: the inability to store electricity in any economically efficient way; and telecommunications being a service in which supply and consumption are concurrent. The logistical problem of water and sanitation supply is to design a distribution network that is able to manage the diurnal demands of customers (Smith 1999).

The physical provision of water and removal of wastewater are the tangible aspects of the service product concept. Supporting, or auxiliary services, as defined by Gr<f6>nroos (1990), are those which supplement and add value to the core service in order to differentiate one service provider from another. An example of a supporting service that could be provided by a water and sanitation provider s advice on the efficient use of water. Facilitation services are those that assist with the delivery and consumption of the core service (Gr<f6>nroos 1990). Examples of these are information provision, order taking, billing and payment. All these activities occur in the retail interface between distribution and consumption of the services (Figure 3).

Vertically integrated monopolistic organisations have little need for supporting services because there is no possibility to differentiate, facilitation services are, however, indispensable. Supporting services can be eliminated and mainly serve a marketing purpose (Gr<f6>nroos 1990). Due to the natural monopoly nature of water and sanitation distribution networks, service providers are not able to differentiate on quality as the same water or sewage flows through the same pipes. In a privatised and marketised retail situation, providers can only compete on supporting and facilitation services.

<h3>Privatisation of the Water and Sanitation Supply Chain</h3>

Not all aspects of the water and sanitation supply chain display natural monopoly characteristics and certain parts are thus suitable for introduction of privately owned service providers. Natural monopolies can be assumed to exist in water storage (large dams), bulk water delivery and distribution and the transport of wastewater. This leaves water sourcing, treatment and water retailing as potentially competitive aspects of the water supply chain. In sanitation services, the collection and treatment of wastewater can be considered suitable for a competitive environment (Essential Services Commission 2009). The privatisation of individual aspects of the supply chain and the breakdown of vertical integration will increase the number of marketing channels in the chain (Kotler et al. 2007). The water and sanitation marketing channel can be separated into four channels, i.e. sourcing, treatment, distribution and retailing (Essential Services Commission 2009).

As indicated by Estache et al. (2005), privatisation of aspects of the supply chain has been implemented in a majority of the countries around the world. This privatisation is, however, mostly limited to private sector partnerships, whilst maintaining government control over the full supply chain. Some aspects of the supply chain that are generally undertaken by private partners of public organisations are the construction of water and sewage reticulation, the operation and maintenance of that infrastructure and in some cases ownership of water and wastewater treatment facilities.

As most water and sanitation supply organisations are currently in vertically integrated public institutions, the entire supply chain is within the control of one group, simplifying the marketing channel for all involved. Vertical integration provides an environment in which the transmission of information, money and the water itself is less complicated than in a non vertically integrated supply chain. However, the simplicity of this supply chain becomes more complex as a competitive model is employed. As each marketing channel consists of dissimilar organisations that cooperate for their common benefit, the behaviour of each of the channel participants is not always aligned with the common goal, leading to channel conflict (Kotler et al. 2007). Introduction of competition in the retail interface for water and sanitation can lead to both horizontal conflict between competitors and vertical conflict between channel participants.

The consequences of not effectively managing the supply chain may be significant for retailers. The Bullwhip Effect phenomenon demonstrates that there can be significant and exaggerated fluctuations in supply in response to demand and the information provided to suppliers (Lee et al. 1997). The consequences of these include supply gluts, insufficient storage and, at times, insufficient supply to meet demand. Challenges in matching supply and demand are often related to imperfections in information transmitted from one organisation to another. By having the retail and supply functions within the same organisation, the speed at which this information may be transmitted, interpreted, discussed and improved upon is faster and more effective providing an advantage to the Government-owned retailer. The impact of this is that the private sector is likely to claim that a level playing field does not exist and the likely result of this is the introduction of probity arrangements to ensure that the information provided to all retailers is substantially similar. Thus, the consequence of introducing partial privatisation of the water and sanitation supply chain is an increased complexity that could lead to negative impacts for customers, unless the supply channel is aligned through information sharing (Lee et al. 1997).

<h2>Service Quality under Privatisation of Retail Services in Water and Sanitation</h2>

Research on the effect of privatisation of water and sanitation utilities mostly focuses on econometric modelling of macroeconomic benefits (Estache et al. 2005; Fumagalli et al. 2007; Picazo-Tadeo et al. 2008) and much less attention has been given to the effects on the levels of customers service (Tsamenyi et al. 2008). Although little research has been undertaken on the relationship between ownership and service quality in water and sanitation services, all networked utility services, such as electricity, gas, telecommunication, water and sanitation can be considered analogous. Firstly, networked utility services are considered a natural monopoly (DiLorenzo 1996) and have traditionally been undertaken by government-owned organisations (Deichmann and Lall 2007). There are also similarities in customer satisfaction determinants between these services, specifically in relation to continuity and quality of supply (Fumagalli et al. 2007; Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007; Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. 2004).

Because of the similarities between networked utility services and the paucity of research in the field of marketing water and sanitation services, this review focuses on research undertaken in different areas of utility provision, mainly electricity retailing. The model used in this paper is static in that it does not address the transition from public to private ownership, but compares the pre- and post-privatisation situation.

<h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>

Customer satisfaction is a consumer's post-purchase evaluation of the overall service experience and is an affective reaction. Customer satisfaction is pivotal to create a sustainable competitive advantage, specifically in relation to customer loyalty (Lovelock et al. 2007). Two approaches to measuring service quality most commonly used are ex-post Customer Satisfaction Surveys or ex-ante evaluations of customer preferences (Ferrari and Salini 2008). Satisfaction of utility services is largely determined by actual service levels but is also influenced by personal characteristics and by the evaluation of services relative to that of the customer's peers (Deichmann and Lall 2007).

An often cited tool for assessing customer perceptions of service quality is SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al. 1988). This instrument provides five crucial dimensions of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">service quality</a>: Reliability, Assurance, Tangibles, Empathy and Responsiveness. The main benefit of SERVQUAL is its ability to examine different service industries such as healthcare, banking, financial services, and education (Nyeck et al. 2007) The SERVQUAL model has also been used in water and sanitation industry (Alegre et al. 2000; Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. 2004).

The provision of services is usually dominated by intangibles, i.e. the service itself is not a physical object. The intangibility of services makes them difficult to visualise and evaluate, which highlights the importance of tangibles in the marketing of services (Lovelock et al. 2007). Tangible aspects of water and sanitation provisions are first and foremost any colour or odour issues related to the provided water or the effectiveness of the sanitation. Other tangible elements of water and sanitation service provision are, for example, the image of employees, publication materials, local offices and so on (Parasuraman et al. 1988). The water and sanitation service provision is, however, dominated by intangible elements as the service is provided with very little interaction between the customer and the service provider. The provision of utility services, such as water and sanitation, can thus be classified as an intangible, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">low-involvement service</a> (Lovelock 1983). Customers will, therefore, place a lower value on the tangible aspects of the end product and more value in the process of service delivery. As long as the service delivery is consistent and reliable, customers may be willing to pay a higher price (Walsch et al. 2005).

Reliability is the ability of a service provider to perform the promised service dependably and accurately (Parasuraman et al. 1988). The importance of reliability is highlighted by the fact that any major breakdown in utility provision usually becomes national news. Research by Deichmann and Lall (2007) undertaken in Bangalore, India, shows that household satisfaction with a utility's performance is directly related to the number of hours per day water is available.

The remaining three parameters in the SERVQUAL model are directly related to the behaviour of staff. Responsiveness encompasses the willingness of staff to help customers and provide prompt service. Assurance is the ability of employees to inspire trust and confidence and empathy relates to the caring and individualised attention a firm provides to customers (Parasuraman et al. 1988).

The core water and sanitation services are delivered at arm's length as they are provided directly on the customer's premises. Supporting and facilitating services, however, rely mostly on direct interaction between staff of the organisation and the customer.

In subsequent work, Zeithaml et al. (1993), developed a model (Figure 4.1) to assess the nature and determinants of customer expectations of service. The conceptual model specifies three different types of service expectations: desired service, adequate service and predicted service. Based on this model, five potential gaps in service provision have been identified, of which three are discussed below.

[caption id=""attachment_6449"" align=""alignnone"" width=""525""]<img class=""wp-image-6449 size-large"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2009/11/ServQualGapModel-1024x832.png"" alt=""Figure 4.1: ServQual Gap Model"" width=""525"" height=""427"" /> Figure 4.1: ServQual Gap Model[/caption]

<strong>Gap 1</strong> - Customer expectations and management's perception of these.

The difference between the customer's expectation of service and management's perception of these expectations is the first gap defined by Zeithaml et al. (1993). In a publicly owned corporation, management's perception of customer expectations are mostly not market driven, but politically motivated, as will be discussed below.

<strong>Gap 2</strong> - Establish the right service quality standards.

The actual service quality standards are the second possible source of service gaps. Public utilities are homogeneous and do not reflect different the demand characteristics of customers (Andreassen 1994; Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. 2004). Andreassen (1994) discussed factors that affect business customer satisfaction in privatised state-owned enterprises and found that heterogeneity among the users of public services is reflected in different demand characteristics and that consequently, various segments of users have significantly varying levels of satisfaction. The defining distinction between publicly and privately owned water and sanitation service providers is that the latter is driven by market forces and will thus be more sensitive to segmentation of their customer service offering.

<strong>Gap 3</strong> - Meeting service provision standards.

As far as meeting the actual service standards, research generally indicates that there is no distinguishing difference between privately and publicly owned service providers (Fumagalli et al. 2007; Estache et al. 2005). The extant research on this topic is, however, focused on meeting the primary service standards, such as continuity and quality of supply, ignoring the supplementary services (Picazo-Tadeo et al. 2008; Tsamenyi et al. 2008).

<h3>Customer Behaviour</h3>

An interesting aspect of utility services provision is that consumer behaviour can affect the quality of service delivery (Fumagalli et al. 2007). In water and sanitation, this is illustrated by the imposition of usage limitations in the form of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/demarketing-water/"">water restrictions</a> in many Australian states. Loyalty is a critical aspect of customer behaviour and a key parameter in creating a financially profitable relationship over time (Lovelock et al. 2007) and is generally considered a more effective business strategy than attempting to acquire new customers as the latter is much more expensive (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007).

Due to the ubiquity of government-owned monopolies in the provision of water and sanitation services, customer loyalty has not played a role of importance in managerial considerations. The natural monopolistic nature of utility services provides a large barrier to access for a competitive market to emerge and changing providers is thus not a viable option for the customer (Deichmann and Lall 2007). However, experience in areas where service provision is open to competition shows that after privatisation and the introduction of a competitive market, most consumers will not be very willing to change (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007). In Germany, electricity consumers have been reluctant to exercise choice and few private electricity customers have switched energy suppliers (Walsch et al. 2005).

According to Hart et al. (1997), a market open to consumer choice in which the customer can assess the service quality, a privatised provider is rewarded for quality-enhancing efforts through repeat purchase by customers. The relationship is, however, more complicated. Several approaches to customer loyalty have been proposed in the literature. Gee et al. (2008) introduce the concept of polygamous customers that are loyal to several brands. In the provision of most utility services, polygamous purchasing behaviour cannot occur because of infrastructure constraints and the natural monopoly, i.e. each house can only have one water and sanitation connection. Brand switching can, however, arise in a situation where the retail function has been privatised, as is commonly the case in telecommunications and the energy market.

[caption id=""attachment_4282"" align=""alignnone"" width=""927""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-4282"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2009/11/hbr.jpg"" alt=""Figure 4.2: Effect of competition on the Satisfaction-Loyalty relationship (Jones and Sasser 1995: 91)."" width=""927"" height=""580"" /> Figure 4.2: Effect of competition on the Satisfaction-Loyalty relationship (Jones and Sasser 1995: 91).[/caption]

Jones and Sasser (1995) provide a model to predict the switching behaviour of customers in a privatised water and sanitation retail market. Common sense would dictate that the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty is linear; the more satisfied a customer is, the more likely they will remain loyal. The relationship is, however, dependent upon the level of competition in the market. For water and sanitation services in a situation of natural monopoly, either privatised or in public hands, the relationship between customer loyalty and satisfaction (Figure 4, top curve) is not relevant as the only choice customers have is either to purchase or not purchase the service. The more competitive a market becomes, the more sensitive customers will be to switching and managing customer satisfaction will not be sufficient to ensure customer loyalty.

Walsch et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of Jones and Sasser (1995) and found that customer satisfaction by itself did not have a significant effect on switching intentions of customers from German energy suppliers. The intangibility and heterogeneity of utility services make the interpretation of brands as promised to the customer of particular importance (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007). The loyalty of residential customers in the energy market depends as much on brand image as on switching cost and satisfaction (Andreassen 1994; Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007). The research by Walsch et al. (2005) indicated that monetary and non-monetary switching cost, risk aversion and lack of transparency in the market are major determinants of the high levels of customer loyalty they found. The market for services can be segmented into 'loyals', 'habituals', 'switchers' and 'multi branders', expressed in the Diamond of Loyalty (Lovelock et al. 2007):

<ul>
    <li><em>Loyals</em> have the highest profit potential and have an active preference for the brand with a strong emotional connection. They also see a high perceived risk in switching brands.</li>
    <li><em>Habituals</em> are passive loyals through inertia. They are behaviourally, but not attitudinal loyal and are passive brand advocates. They are susceptible to switching when there is a service failure or through competitor's promotional deals. Their retention is mostly based on convenience and switching costs.</li>
    <li><em>Multi branders</em> have a small repertoire of service brands and actively search based on quality and price. They have little involvement in the brand and often seek variety for its sake.</li>
    <li><em>Switchers</em> are characterised by a broad portfolio or brands and are sensitive to price promotions and have a low perceived risk of switching.</li>
</ul>

In summary, service marketing theory (Jones and Sasser 1995; Lovelock et al. 2007) and research in the retail of utilities (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007; Walker and Johnson 2005) show that a correlation exists between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. There is, however, no direct causality between satisfaction and loyalty as other confounding variables, such as customer psychology and brand image, are at play.

Given the experience in some privatised utility markets (Hartmann and Ib<e1><f1>ez 2007; Walker and Johnson 2005), most customers could possibly be classified as either Loyals or Habituals. The implications for managers is that managing customer satisfaction will not be sufficient to stimulate loyalty, as shown by Jones and Sasser (1995). The central question to be asked is whether the existence of loyalty segmentation as confirmed by Walsch et al. (2005) for electricity retail in Germany, as exists in water and sanitation retailing.

<h3>Managerial behaviour</h3>

One aspect of the relationship between ownership structure and service quality in utility provision that has not been given much attention in the literature is the impact of managerial behaviour on customer service levels (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Managerial behaviour impacts on service quality through job design, staff empowerment and development (Lovelock et al. 2007).

<blockquote>Although voter satisfaction is related to customer satisfaction, it is a poor proxy.</blockquote>

A significant difference between a privately or publicly owned service provider is the intention of the owners. In publicly owned organisations, managers are separated from the owners, while in privately owned organisations, the owners play a direct role in the management of the firm through directors. The core purpose of a privately owned corporation is to maximise the return for its stakeholders while for publicly owned organisations the objectives are often political (Du Plessis et al. 2005). Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. (2004), however, states that regardless of their ownership structure, all water and sanitation service providers share a common purpose and management objectives (Sepp<e4>l<e4> et al. 2004), which was defined by Alegre et al. (2000) as: ""The achievement of the highest level of consumer satisfaction and service quality in line with the prevailing regulatory framework, whilst making best use of available resources"". Although it can be considered a truism that customer satisfaction is the primary aim of both public and private organisations, the managerial behaviour will be very different. A profit-maximising privately owned firm will improve quality to the point where the marginal benefit to the consumers of additional quality equals the marginal cost to the business of increasing quality. For a politically oriented publicly owned firm, quality improvements are often more related to the political will of the responsible governments than to customer perception (Fumagalli et al. 2007). Although voter satisfaction is related to customer satisfaction, it is a poor proxy.

Managers of a publicly owned utility service provider are separated from the owners and have 'private costs' of decisions that negatively impact on service quality, while in privately owned corporations, managers negate private benefits, usually in the form of reduced income (Fumagalli et al. 2007).
In private industry, managers have greater freedom to set a corporate strategy and raise capital as is the case in publicly owned organisations (Andreassen 1994; Fumagalli et al. 2007). Managers in privately owned corporations are disciplined, i.e. act in the best interest of the company, through the existence of competitors (Andreassen 1994; Deichmann and Lall 2007; Fumagalli et al. 2007). This principle assumes that effective corporate governance is in place to negate the Agency Problem, i.e. the problem of managers adopting discretionary behaviours other than investments (Du Plessis et al. 2005; Fumagalli et al. 2007).

Fumagalli et al. (2007) analysed the relationship between privatisation and service quality in the electricity industry and explored the autonomous role of managerial behaviour. They found that a reduction in management dominance through the larger presence of external directors resulted in a better supply quality.

Improvements in performance due to privatisation or regulation can be explained by the introduction of new management styles and techniques, leading to increased organisational efficiency and design. Top management signals are one of the most influential forces driving a market organisation (Andreassen 1994).

<h2>Synthesis</h2>

The past decades, water and sanitation service providers have been privatised in several jurisdictions around the world. The motivation for this wave of reform is predominantly based on econometric considerations. Evidence on the effectiveness of privatisation is mixed but point towards there being no significant economic difference. The research on this topic has been widely myopic of the marketing implications of privatisation. Also, the environmental complexity and the myriad of confounding variables, in particular, differences in legislation around the globe, frustrate the possibility of drawing firm conclusions.

A review of the extant literature on the privatisation of utility services and services marketing theory shows managerial behaviour as a possible independent variable influencing customer satisfaction as described in the relational model in figure 5.1.

The transition from publicly- to a privately-owned provision of water and sanitation services has been driven by a quest for improved efficiency, demonstrated by the recent wave of water privatisation of most networked utility services. In many countries around the world, there is already significant private investment in the provision of water and sanitation services, but the impact of privatisation on the level of customer service has been widely ignored.

It is argued that a change of ownership structure in the provision of retailing services significantly improves the behaviour of managers that are responsible for the interfunctional coordination of the service organisation. As described in the conceptual model, this has a direct impact on all at least three dimensions of the SERVQUAL service provision model: Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy. The consequent change in service quality acts to influence customer satisfaction and in turn altering customers' loyalty behaviours.

The proposed model, though based on germane secondary research, has been developed under the assumption that networked services such as telecommunications, transport and energy are analogous to water and sanitation services. It is proposed that future research is undertaken to focus on testing this model, specifically within water and sanitation service provision. Given the upcoming changes to the contestable provision of services in the Victorian water and sanitation sector recommended by the Essential Services Commission, the ideal industry environment exists to test the model. In doing so, this model may provide insights into how the industry may transition to a free-market model in which each of the parties involved in the transaction described by Milton Friedman in the epigraph will receive maximum benefit.

89,theory-and-practice-of-management,"Theory and Practice of Management: Humbug, Buzzwords and Fads","One of the grave problems in the theory and practice of management is the dominance of buzzwords, fads and humbug. Just a quick look at the management section in the local bookshop will prove this point. <a href=""https://horizonofreason.com/management-philosophy/"" rel=""noopener"">Management thinkers</a> are possibly some of the most influential people of the current age. They influence, for better or worse, the lives of millions of people and have even spawned a separate language, flushed with <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/weasel-words/"">buzzwords</a>.

Management thinking is, due to its very nature, entrepreneurial and everybody who has an idea wants to ensure that as many people as possible read it and perhaps make a few bucks in the process. More than any other science, management ideas are primarily developed to make money, and people are willing to pay good money for them, as innovative ideas can significantly impact the bottom line.

This article briefly reviews the relationship between theory and practice in management in light of the dominance of pseudoscience in business.

<h2>Theory and Practice of Management</h2>

A problem with the theory and practice of management is that solid scientific research does not underpin many management theories. As a working manager, you need to be equipped with a pretty good 'bullshit radar'. Looking around the management section of the average bookshop the volumes on sale do not seem to meet the rigour of academic research. Popular management books give you 'simple solutions' to success. <em>Good to Great</em> by Jim Collins is one of the best selling volumes in this genre.

The Business Pundit blog provides an excellent critique of Collins' pseudo-scientific writing. The book is touted to be based on solid scientific analysis of data, but in fact, relies mostly on Jim's intuition (p. 11):

<blockquote>""We all have a strength or two in life, and I suppose mine is the ability to take a lump of unorganized information, see patterns, and extract order from the mess - to go from chaos to concept.""</blockquote>

Collins did not use any advanced statistical analysis of the data, and there are no indications of the validity of his findings. Although he repeatedly emphasises the data, his interpretation of the data is not scientific but based on intuition. There is nothing wrong with using intuition to make <em>specific</em> <em>decisions</em>, but you can not call it science and generate <em>general rules</em> for good business management unless findings have a solid foundation. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/analyse-enron-corpus/"">Enron</a>, one of the companies that according to Collins went from Good to Great, but after the Global Financial Crisis, it quickly became apparent that Enron's success was just smoke and mirrors.

The reason pseudo-scientific books like <em>Good to Great</em> are bestsellers is that our brains are not naturally wired to be critical thinkers. The success of a lot of business literature is based on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"">confirmation bias</a> and the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/self-knowledge-for-managers/"">Forer Effect</a>. We prefer information that confirms our preconceptions. Also, most popular management theory does not go beyond self-fulfilling prophecy, and broad sweeping general statements and its popularity is in essence based on the same psychological principle that explains the success of astrology and other forms of divination.

Another problem is that the average manager does not have the capability or motivation to understand elaborate theories that underpin human behaviour fully. Managers don't want to read complicated scientific theories. Good advice to those who seek to write a management best seller is to stay away from using any sophisticated analysis.

Management is, in essence, a social science that aims to influence human behaviour to achieve a collective goal, whether that be increasing profit or creating a great piece of orchestral music. Management seeks to change the behaviour of customers to convince them to purchase goods or services. Management tries to influence employees to ensure goal-oriented behaviour. Management theory is also about influencing or anticipating the behaviour of the external world, i.e. the stakeholders and possible competitors.

<h2>Nothing More Practical than a Good Theory</h2>

As a social science, management does not follow the strict rules of the natural sciences. There are no simple formulas to ensure staff motivation, increases sales volumes or assuring customer satisfaction. Management is about human behaviour, which is intrinsically unpredictable. Collins and other popular management writers do not use scientific methods, but there are natural limits to what the scientific method can achieve in management. All we can hope to achieve is to develop statistical models. These models do, however, not produce simple statements about friendly concepts such as 'Level 5 Leadership' and the 'Hedgehog principle'. At best, the scientific analysis provides partial insights into a very specific phenomenon instead of the organisation as a whole.

There are also too many practical and ethical issues with undertaking full-scale management experiments that would be required to make the sort of claims that Collins promoted in <em>Good to Great</em>. Merely looking at sets of data from the past can not generate such claims because there are too many confounding variables that are not covered by the data. In other words: the principles distilled by Collins might not be the only reasons these hand-picked companies were successful.

Scientific theories do, however, remain an essential tool to regulate our intuition. Before we had a consistent theory of gravity, architects were very limited by the size of buildings they could create. As our theoretical and practical knowledge of physics increased, so did the size and complexity of structures. A theory is required to propel human knowledge and even though management is many times more complicated than skyscrapers, using only intuition will not improve our understanding of managing organisations.

In conclusion, because management is a social science, we can not rely on theoretical models alone. Working with people requires insight and intuition that can only be obtained by life experience. However, theory underpins our intuition, and in the end, there is nothing more practical than a good theory."
88,mba-deception,"When you see an MBA on the road, kill them! The MBA Deception","After two years of intense studying, writing more than 75,000 words, many exams, hundreds of hours of lectures and a fascinating <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/human-resource-management-in-hanoi/"">expedition to Hanoi</a>, Ian and I have finally formally graduated for my MBA.

When starting this journey, I asked myself whether I would be wasting my time. Well, it was not a waste of time - learned some interesting things; visited a fascinating city; met great people and did some exciting <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/half-hour-mba/"">research</a>. During my two years of intensive study, I have, however, also cultivated a critical attitude towards the material touted as management theory.

One important aspect that seems to be forgotten in many management books is that running a business is first and foremost about the actual production process and provision of service. Management supports these activities, but cannot replace them. Studying management does, for example, not teach you anything about how to make the best horse saddles or provide world-class healthcare.

If management theory is separated from what the business is about, the organisation can fall victim to fads that only achieve to alienate the people it is supposed to help.

Henry Mintzberg, copiously referenced in graduate schools around the world, is <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/83/mbamenace.html"">critical of the MBA phenomenon</a> and argues that no education can teach intuition, creativity or insight:

<blockquote>Management is not a profession, nor is it science. It is a <em>practice</em> that depends mostly on craft and significantly on art. Craft is learned by experience. Art can, of course, be admired in a classroom--think of all the visionaries you read about in cases. But voyeurism is not management, either, nor does it develop creativity.</blockquote>

The Frugal Law Student refers to a New York Times article about the favourite books of the most successful Chief Executive Officers. Interestingly enough, they do not seem to read books like <em>From Good to Great</em>, <em>Seven Habits of Effective People</em>, <em>Six Thinking Hats</em> or any other self-help book. Their favourite books are fiction, poetry, philosophy and biographies. To become a good manager, it is essential to be well rounded and read the classics.

The title of this post is inspired by the traditional Zen koan attributed to Zen Master Linji:

<blockquote>If you meet the Buddha, kill him.</blockquote>

What Linji is trying to say is that those who are on the road to enlightenment should ignore all their perceived conceptions of what enlightenment is. This kernel of wisdom also applies to the halo some people seem to adorn themselves with after completing an MBA.

70,lessons-on-entrepreneurship,Enter the Dragon <97> Six Simple Lessons on Entrepreneurship,"Wearing bright pink pants, white T-shirt and green sash, I stood looking through the barbed wire and plague locusts at the trees filled, for the first time in Bendigo's history, with a smelly and squawking colony of fruit bats. The sound of Mancini's <em>Pink Panther</em> theme was a stark counterpoint to the apocalyptic feel of the marshalling area and was an odd but pleasing reminder that, out there, people celebrated the festivities of the 140<sup>th</sup> <a href=""https://www.bendigoeasterfestival.org.au/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Bendigo Easter Festival</a>.

My strange outfit matched that of the other sixty men, whose job it was to spread out over the length of <em>Sun Loong</em><97>the forty-year-old, one hundred meters long imperial dragon<97>and carried him through the crowd; the grand finale of the Festival's Easter Monday street parade. When I hoisted the bamboo and silk dragon's midsection above my head, the one thing I least expected to receive was a motivating <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/essence-of-entrepreneurship/"">lessons on entrepreneurship</a>. After being swept the 500 metres toward the parade starting area, each of the dragon-bearers had an hour to wait. This moment was when I met Ewan.

<h2>Lessons on entrepreneurship</h2>

Ewan was a fifty-something with close-cropped hair and a no-nonsense attitude. We talked about our kids, and he mentioned how he enjoyed the time he could spend with his children because Ewan works from home<97>something he has done for a great many years. Ewan explained he could do this because he has a passion for starting up businesses and growing them. He also mentioned the many and varied industries in which he'd worked: pay-TV, repossessions, logistics, telecommunications; to name a few. Though I have no idea what level of success he's achieved in any of the businesses in financial terms, it was clear that he had thoroughly enjoyed starting each business, each industry (except telecommunications) and he loved the lifestyle his choices afforded him. Throughout our discussion, he generously offered a lot of advice about how to avoid working for someone else. There's only one way to do something: your way. Some of Ewan's <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/essence-of-entrepreneurship/"">lessons on entrepreneurship</a> were:

<ul>
    <li>Start small and build up<97>that way you avoid getting trapped if the idea doesn't work.</li>
    <li>Seek out a niche<97>something that no-one has thought of or bothered with.</li>
    <li>Avoid employing people<97>where possible use subcontractors.</li>
    <li>You don't need the training to be an entrepreneur.</li>
    <li>Treat others the way you expect to be treated: with honesty and integrity.</li>
    <li>Avoid the telecommunications industry<97>no one is making money in telecoms.</li>
</ul>

The shout went up that it was time for the dragon to march its way through the streets lined with families from all over Victoria. As I watched Ewan's feet shuffle ahead of mine, I thought about what it is that makes him or any other entrepreneur successful. It's an indefinable mix of self-confidence, energy, cleverness and determination that predisposes them to succeed.

After 4,237 steps over 2.1 kilometres, I helped Sun Loong rest in his Museum home to sleep for another year reluctantly. I returned to my regular clothing, none of which is pink, and walked out into the sunlight and away from the barbed wire enclosure, the bats and the locusts.

I don't believe in signs, omens, or 'messages from the universe' and having walked through an apparent apocalypse, I left with a much better sense of entrepreneurship and what it is to have a real love of business<97>something I never expected when I entered the dragon."
190,approaches-to-strategic-management,"Blood, Sun Tzu and the Four Approaches to Strategic Management","<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-management-and-business-performance/"">Strategic management</a> is often compared with warfare. Humans have had, and sadly still appear to have, a profoundly disturbing need to settle conflict using armed warfare. While stories of the battle abound in prose, poem, song and cinema, there is usually only a glib allusion to the thought and preparation made before the slaughter itself. Though premeditation before the wholesale murder is an unsavoury concept, it is from this conscious anticipation of brutality that the art of strategy was born; to save oneself and one's friends at the expense of foes.

<h2>Sun Tzu and Strategy</h2>

An often translated and studied treatise on strategy is that of a Chinese General from around 2600 years ago named Sun Tzu.[note]Wing, R.L. (1997) <em>The Art of Strategy: The Leading Modern Translation of Sun Tzu's Classic The Art of War. </em>Thorsons.[/note] Though this is one of the earliest known documented manuals on the topic of strategy, it is likely that military strategy pre-dated Sun Tzu. Initially, mainly when applied to the military, the desired outcome of a well-executed strategy was to gain an advantage over others at their expense. As applied to business in the modern era, strategy is becoming more often used to gain competitive advantage while benefiting all involved in the value chain. A positive outcome may also be obtained for one's competitors as long as a sustainable competitive advantage is maintained for oneself.

A single definition of strategy simply doesn't exist. With each commentator on the topic of strategy, there appears to be an accompanying definition. An excellent definition described by<a0>Colin White (2004) and<a0>de Wit and Meyer (1998)<a0>is any course of action for achieving an organisation's purpose(s).[note]White, C (2004)<a0><em>Strategic Management</em>.<a0>Palgrave Macmillan;<a0>De Wit, B. and Meyer, R. (1994) <em>Strategy: Process, Content, Context</em>, West Publishing, New York.[/note] This is an all-encompassing definition that includes all of a businesses' productive activity, and it is this definition that will be used for this essay.

Having provided the general purpose and definition of strategy, this essay will describe four approaches that may be taken to making strategy. Additionally, it will be argued that without a healthy workplace culture, elements of the four approaches are likely to be used within a single organisation.

<h2>Approaches to Strategic Management</h2>

Developing a strategy is described most commonly in literature as being based on the way in which the process of strategy is developed and the desired outcome of that strategy. The process of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-management-and-serendipity/"">strategy development</a> is either deliberate or emergent (or adaptive) while the desired outcome is to maximise profit or to achieve multiple purposes (plural).[note]Whittington, R (2001) <em>What is Strategy and Does it Matter </em>Cengage Learning.[/note]

These form a matrix of four basic approaches to strategic management that may be taken to make a strategy. The four approaches to strategic management are Classical, Evolutionary, Systemic and Processual, each of which is described in detail below.

<h3>Classical</h3>

The classical approach to strategy making is the deliberate process of developing a strategy to maximise profit. This approach, though described as classical, was mainly developed and propounded by management strategists in the 1960s such as Igor Ansoff and Alfred Sloan.[note]Richard Whittington, 2001.[/note] Sloan, the former chief of General Motors, was credited with much of the organisation's early success predominantly due to his approach of thoughtful examination of the internal and external environment and then developing a strategy to direct resources to meet the company's long-term goals.[note]Richard Whittington, 2001.[/note] The long-term aim of the classical approach to strategy is precisely to make a profit, and this is best summed up in Sloan's words from his biography;

<blockquote>The strategic aim of a business is to earn a return on capital, and if in any particular case the return in the long run is not satisfactory, the deficiency should be corrected or the activity abandoned. (Richard Whittington, 2001).</blockquote>

This very rational approach has advantages where a change in markets and the industry move relatively slowly and where reasonable confidence can be achieved in long-term financial modelling. The classical approach relies on the strategic capability being concentrated in the organisational leader and his or her ability to suitably commanding the organisation. For this reason, particularly due to cognitive limitations in decision making by individuals, many organisations are adopting an approach that, while focusing on business profitability, acknowledges the dynamic processes acting upon and within the organisation.

<h3>Evolutionary</h3>

The evolutionary approach to strategy is based on the view that the organisation is operating within an economic environment that is ever changing. The role of strategy, in this case, is to respond to the environment for survival and profit. The main reason that this process is known as evolutionary is that it is similar to Darwinian theory in biology where only those individuals, or in this case strategies, best equipped to survive environmental or economic pressures do so (Colin White, 2004). An example of this is the strategy of Sony during the 1980s where they released well over 100 different versions of their portable cassette player, the Walkman, and allowed the market to decide which would survive and which would be removed from the market through failure.[note]Richard Whittington, 2001.[/note]

<h3>Processual</h3>

The processual view is that the business environment is messy and largely unpredictable (Richard Whittington, 2001). Additionally, with this approach, there is an acknowledgement that decision-makers cannot act with pure reason and that only a few factors affecting a decision can be dealt with. This limitation of human cognition is known as bounded rationality (Simon, 1982).

To make sense of the<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-management-and-serendipity/""> chaos of the world</a> in which the organisation operates, managers develop models, or processes, to help make decisions. These models are known to be imperfect representations of the complicated world but the help the strategist to identify and quickly respond to forces acting upon the organisation. The models that are used for decision-making may be explicit and documented or cognitive.

Ultimately, because there is an acceptance that the world is messy and unpredictable, it is accepted that maximising profit is not within the control of the strategist and sufficient profit becomes the goal. To achieve this, there is also a<a0> prevalence of satisficing in environments which are tolerant of under-performance (Colin White, 2004) where the decision maker looks for a satisfactory, rather than an optimal, alternative.[note]Simon, H. A. (1982) <em>Models of Bounded Rationality</em>. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.

<h3>Systemic</h3>

The systemic approach is taken by those that understand the need to play by the local rules (Richard Whittington, 2001). The cultural context is key to the development of the strategy. This may be a function of the way that a family culture influences a business or may also be influenced by the local cultures with different levels of uncertainty avoidance, power distance, collectivism, masculinity (Hofstede, 1983) and long-term vs short-term orientation. The systemic approach toward strategy is the deliberate development of a strategy to meet cultural and societal needs while maintaining sufficient profit.

<h2>Inevitable co-existence of multiple approaches</h2>

In determining which approach to strategy-making will be taken within an organisation, it is important first to understand who the strategist or strategists are within the organisation. The classical approach commonly has the organisational leader as the source of strategy development and the driver of strategy implementation. The more modern approach is not only the acceptance but the goal of engaging everybody in an organisation as a strategist.

An organisation is not a single entity but is instead made up of numerous individuals that hold different views of labour, economics, planning and the organisation's goals. Though it is the role of the strategists within an organisation to align their activities to achieve the organisation's goals, even under optimal conditions, this will be incomplete.

It may also be possible that this may not be in the best interests of the organisation to have all of the strategists of one mind. While a managing director or president or chief executive may propound to deliberately and methodically plan a long-term strategy to deliver profits to the organisation, it is the line managers that will usually develop decision-making models that will help respond to the changing environment. It may also be the case that a work-group is operating within a different society or culture and though they do deliberately plan but also understand that they need to play by local rules. Throughout this, each strategy that develops either succeeds or fails and the strategy of the organisation evolves.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It is because an organisation has many working within it that opinions and approaches will differ towards strategy. Co-existence of multiple approaches to strategic management is inevitable without the development of either a powerful organisational culture, a human resource monoculture or extremely prescriptive management, such as in the armed forces. For this reason, it is likely that a single approach will never occur, but within an organisation, it is likely that more than one approach to strategy will be represented.

Regardless of the approach taken, the judgement of the success of a strategy is measured by whether the desired outcomes have been achieved. In examining and using strategy within the business, we may consider ourselves fortunate that these outcomes require no bloodshed; the original reason that strategy was first developed.

117,time-poverty,Make Time Poverty History! The Cult of Being Busy,"<blockquote>Good morning Agnes, how are you? You know how it is, busy, busy, busy ... Have you read my latest proposal? No sorry, I am very time poor.</blockquote>

As affluence has spread across Australia and parts of the rest of the world, time seems to be the new frontier of poverty. When asking the average professional what is happening in their life, the word 'busy' is frequently uttered. If they seek your sympathy, they use the superlative neologism ""<em>Time Poor</em>"".

The underlying message is that, although these time poor people are financially wealthy, we should feel sorry for them as they equate themselves with the poor people of the world. They are, however, not poor cash poor, but time poor. We need to establish a charity and sell white sympathy <a href=""http://www.makepovertyhistory.com.au/"">wristbands</a>.

<blockquote>Make <strong>TIME POVERTY</strong> history</blockquote>

Time Poverty is, however, more often than not a self-induced state of mind and not an actual state of affairs. It is not about a factual lack of available time, but the perception of a lack of available time. Being time poor and being busy has almost become a status symbol in what Scott Berkun describes as the <em>Cult of Busy</em>:

<blockquote>""That simply by always seeming to have something to do, we all assume you must be important or successful. It explains the behaviour of many people at work. By appearing busy, people bother them less, and simultaneously believe they 're doing well at their job.""</blockquote>

For some strange reason, as Berkin points out, a manager with a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/scarcity-marketing/"">long line of people at her door</a> will command respect, but a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/call-centre-workforce-planning-erlang-c-in-r/"">long line at a supermarket register</a> will create frustration.

The <em>Cult of Busy</em> has a large following and has spawned numerous courses and books for managers seeking to squeeze more productive minutes out of a day. A manager I worked with some years ago suffered from extreme time poverty. He was always busy but never seemed to achieve much. He decided to sign up for a time management course. Unfortunately, he was so busy that he forgot to attend the class!

<h2>Make Time Poverty History</h2>

Being busy is a<a0>status symbol for the ostensibly successful manager. If you are not busy or if you have enough spare time to speak to people, you are obviously not very good at what you do, is the subconscious reasoning.

Some people attempt to alleviate their time poverty by trying to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/myth-of-multitasking/"">multi-task</a>, but that only leads to suboptimal outcomes because our brains are just not wired to project our attention to more than one thing simultaneously. Yes, you can do something physical and mental at the same time, but you cannot spread your psychological attention across two mental tasks. So leave your laptops closed at meetings unless you take notes about the proceedings.

Sadly, accompanying the new Cult of Busy is also an abundance of guides available to support this hyperactive charade. <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Look-Busy-at-Work-Without-Really-Working"">WikiHow</a> even provides a comprehensive program for those who want to join the ranks of the apparent time poor:

<ul>
    <li>Know what the standards are (so you meet them).</li>
    <li>Create the illusion of furious activity (somewhat messy desk, lots of windows open on your<a0>computer, post-it notes around the monitor).</li>
    <li>Ask lots of intelligent questions to make each task appear more complicated than it is.</li>
    <li>Be alert and watch out for 'big brother'.</li>
    <li>Carry a backup prop or document and make sure you have a cover story ready.</li>
    <li>Send packages to yourself with documents to 'review'.</li>
    <li>Have personal conversations and phone calls away from your workspace.</li>
    <li>Don't brag to anyone that you're doing any of the above.</li>
</ul>

In contrast, a lucid manager is never time poor but takes control over the available time to them. A Lucid Manager might have a lot to do but rarely says ""I don't have time"" or ""I am busy"". A Lucid Manager <a title=""Clear Your head <96> The Key to Getting Things Done"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/clearing-your-head/"">works efficiently</a> and does not choose to live in false poverty but leads a productive life full of achievement.

Next time when you are very busy, and somebody asks a question, don't brush them off by saying your busy but listen to their needs."
179,disappearing-teaspoons,The Passive Aggressive Battle of the Disappearing Teaspoons,"It doesn't matter how well-designed, functional or beautiful your office tea-room or kitchen is, it almost seems utterly useless if you can't find a teaspoon. From time-to-time, someone will snap, and there will be a call to arms. The indignant party who leads the charge will usually be well-meaning and genuinely concerned about standing up for the rights of others needing to create a vortex in their hot beverage of choice.

Emails go out; complaints are lodged and, if the workplace culture is entirely wrong, painfully polite and hilariously, hostile <a title=""Passive Aggressive Notes"" href=""http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/"">passive aggressive notes</a> will adorn the tearoom. After some weeks of torment, the intractable problem will be solved by buying some more spoons, but not before several people have walked around feeling guilty while the spoon crusaders end up muttering about never being listened to. All of this is avoidable once you understand the science behind spoon migration.

Science? Spoon Migration? Yes, it has been studied and published in the <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/"">British Medical Journal</a>. A research study at the <em>Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health Research</em> at the Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health in Melbourne, Australia found that the half-life of teaspoons in their common tea room was 42 days.[note]Lim, Megan S C and Hellard, Margaret E and Aitken, Campbell K (2005) The case of the disappearing teaspoons: longitudinal cohort study of the displacement of teaspoons in an Australian research institute. <em>BMJ</em> (331)7531: p. 1498<96>1500. doi: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1498"">10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1498</a>.[/note]

That's right; it's been studied by a group of epidemiologists and, to paraphrase and butcher their results, the conclusion is: communal teaspoons will eventually disappear. This research has sparked a range of possible management interventions, including:

<ul>
    <li>Don't provide spoons</li>
    <li>Provide disposable stirrers</li>
    <li>Provide spoons on a heavy chain</li>
    <li>Just accept that people are going to take them and buy more spoons</li>
</ul>

Do we defend the practice of stealing office property, regardless of how small, shiny and valueless it is? Of course not! We should, however, understand which fights are worth fighting. Or in the wise words of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/approaches-to-strategic-management/"">Sun Tzu</a>:

<blockquote>He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.</blockquote>

To provide a simple guide to where disappearing teaspoons fit into the scheme of things, consider the following list:

<ul>
    <li>Occupational Health and Safety issues</li>
    <li>Working to gain multi-million dollar revenue streams</li>
    <li>Teaspoons</li>
    <li>Ensuring you've employed <a title=""Getting the employees you deserve - thoughts on recruitment"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/recruitment/"">the right people for the job</a></li>
    <li>Making sure your telecommunication systems are running effectively</li>
    <li>Ensuring your corporate image is one that <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/sociological-imagination-in-marketing/"">appeals to consumers</a></li>
</ul>

Note that the list above could have been written in any order and the addition of teaspoons will always appear unworthy and unwelcome. The Battle of the Disappearing Teaspoons is not an important issue.

For the amount of time and effort, people will spend badgering other staff members about disappearing teaspoons, complaining, writing nasty notes and disrupting the workplace, based on epidemiological science, if you have a tearoom it is best to accept that you will regularly need to buy spoons. This one simple tip will help avoid a lot of the angst and pain of not being able to measure your morning caffeine dose accurately.

172,generation-y,Generation Y Does Not Exist,"Many articles about<a0>management discuss the so-called <em>Generation Y. </em>Authors analyse their motivations, lament their supposed high expectations and so on. This arbitrary dividing of people into generational cohorts is, however, counterproductive.

In my spare time, I occasionally perform <a title=""Magic Perspectives"" href=""https://magicperspectives.net/"">magic shows</a> for adults and children. Recently I was reading a booklet by David Kaye, who performs for children under the name <a href=""http://www.sillybillymagic.com/"">Silly Billy</a>.[note]David Kaye,<em> The First Century of Children's Magic</em>.[/note]

<blockquote>Through the so-called benefits of science<97>the impossible exploits of movie heroes, blood-curdling action stories in video games - the child is thrilled to such an extent that a magician's bag of tricks becomes a poor substitute. All this has brought about another more malicious change. Fifteen or twenty years ago the average child was well-mannered, quiet and attentive. The magician had very little difficulty keeping them under control. Today it appears that those few exceptions have become the rule. Children are more ill-mannered. They have less respect for their elders and the conduct in public places is often far from commendable.</blockquote>

This quote illustrates an often heard complaint about the younger generations. But there is more to this quote that meets the eye. Just like in a magic show, I have deceived you a little.

Eddie Clever wrote this paragraph in 1939! Kaye only changed <93>radio shows<94> to <93>video games<94> and all of a sudden it looks as if it was written yesterday. We can go even further back to find similar concerns about the younger generations. There are records of Dutch priests in the 18<sup>th</sup> century lamenting the lewd and drunken behaviour of the young people in his parish. Have young people changed? People have not changed, it is us our perception of them that changes as we grow older.

<h2>Generation Y does not exist!</h2>

This finding has a direct bearing on a concept that that is frequently used in our cultural landscape and contemporary management: <em>Baby Boomers</em>, <em>Generation X</em>, <em>Generation Y</em> and other broad sweeping categorisations. In much of the management literature on this topic, it is made to believe that the young professionals of today are different from the way the authors themselves once were and should thus be treated differently.

There are distinct differences between age cohorts. As we go through the stages of life, we mature, and our priorities change. There are, however, no psychological differences between age groups in the past, present or future. Our <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/self-knowledge-for-managers/"">psychological make-up</a> does not evolve fast enough for us to notice any differences.

Sure, you can classify people by the era in which they were born, but to think that they are in any way psychologically different to the way Generation X or Baby Boomers were when they were at the same age as any evidence does not support generation Y. The perceived generational problem is only caused by a lack of the older generations to be able to understand the others."
162,deception-in-recruitment,The Lies We Tell <97> Double Deception in Recruitment,"Matt was nervous. Most people are under the circumstances. Matt sat in front of the recruitment specialist, hoping that he'd end up with the job that was on offer. It was a step up from what he had done in the past<97>in pay, responsibility and influence.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Daniel, the Recruitment Manager, pushed a folded piece of paper and a pencil across the table to Matt and then did something appalling. He lied.</p>

<blockquote><93>Please answer the questions for this <a title=""Personality Test"" href=""http://www.lucidmanager.org/free-personality-test"">personality test</a> there are no right or wrong answers<94>, Daniel reassured Matt.</blockquote>

Mind you, Daniel had no intention of lying nor did he even realise that he had, at the time. ""There are no right or wrongs answers"", is a lie that many managers and human resources professionals use from time to time. The personality tests that are conducted in workplaces throughout the world in job interviews have no answer that is intrinsically correct<97>as you might find in a high school mathematics exam. However, the presence of a series of questions that are included as part of the selection process for an employment role makes a lie of Daniel's reassurance.

<h2>Deception in Recruitment</h2>

If a recruitment test of any kind is used in the context of an employee selection process, there is an intention to use it to justify the selection of a particular candidate and to exclude others. It has already been decided by the interviewer, recruitment expert or organisation that a specific personality is required for the role (or, conversely, that particular personality profiles are to be avoided). This simple truth means that for the organisation, responses on the personality test <em>are</em>, in fact, right or wrong.

Looking at personality tests from the candidate experiencing the job interview process, there are also right and wrong answers. In our example, Matt desperately wants the job but does not necessarily know what personality profile Daniel is looking for, nor does Matt know what responses he needs to give to present the 'right' personality profile for the job. Additionally, he knows that he should be honest during a job interview. When nervous, the tension created by the need, to be frank, and also the desire to meet the needs of the interviewer is unlikely to help Matt through the selection process nor help Daniel find the right candidate.

Set aside for now whether there is any validity in using Myers-Briggs, Keirsey, DISC or any other <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/free-personality-test/"">personality test</a> or temperament sorter in a job interview, the simple message is that there are lies in the workplace that we use to smooth the path or appease people, but they are still lies.

A Lucid Manager will make every effort to assist Matt through the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">interview process</a> and would also be aware that there is a right or wrong answer to every question in a job interview<97>the solution that demonstrates suitability for the job.

A formalised job interview is counter-productive human interaction with limited predictive quality when it comes to getting to know a person. The artificial nature of the job interview does, however, prevent this process from being rational. Useful job interviews should be based on the presumption of equality between the recruiter and the applicant to espouse genuine conversations between the parties. It is the task of the recruiter to make the candidate feel comfortable and treat them as an equal conversation partner. Only this way will you be able to get to know the person on the other side of the table.

296,motivation,The Mysteries of Motivation: A tale of carrots and sticks,"When the enterprise agreement in an organisation comes to an end and both management and staff are prepared to enter the trenches for the next round of negotiations.

Having participated in two such negotiations, on both sides of the table, I have learnt a lot about the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/predicting-behaviour/"">irrationality of people's motivations</a>. One such expression of insanity is the argument is that more pay will motivate people to perform better. But does the old carrot-and-stick approach always work? Will the promise of a bonus make workers slobber like dogs on a treadmill?

Unfortunately, management scholars and psychologists cannot agree on what motivates us. There are almost as many motivation theories as there are religions. One thing is sure, the traditional behaviourally view that you should offer monetary rewards to achieve the required behaviour does not have a lot of support.

Recent experiments show that the traditional motivational theories only work for simple physical activities. As soon as the job requires intellectual activity this argument does not apply; what is worse, productivity even decreases when linking performance to pay.

Watch this excellent presentation from <a href=""http://www.thersa.org/"">theRSA.org</a> in which these fascinating experiments are discussed.

96,learning-how-to-drive-a-bus,Learning How to Drive a Bus: A Lesson in Gratitude,"One day last summer, on my way to work and dressed in my business suit, I boarded the bus to find only two other people on board: a trainee driver and his instructor sitting two rows back from him. As I boarded, I said, ""Good morning"" to the driver. When I walked past the instructor, he said, ""It's going to be easy for you, working in your air-conditioned office all day while we're stuck in this thing for ten-and-a-half hours in this heat.""

Admittedly the weather forecast was for 42<b0>C throughout the day: I did feel some sympathy for their situation and responded, ""I hope it won't be too bad for you today"".

I sat down and thought about how, despite it being the Monday after an excellent weekend, I was going to work feeling that the following week held many possible opportunities and felt quite confident. The instructor's remarks were, however, as the arrival of dark clouds.

I sat quietly and decided not to allow someone else to choose my mood for me, so I set aside his remarks and mentally prepared for the day ahead. He concluded, however, that he wasn't finished with me yet.

Apropos of nothing, he told me that his philosophy on life was to ""<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/cynical-manager/"">Trust no bastard and hate everyone</a>"". I had come across people that had a bleak view of humanity in the past, but few who rivalled the instructor's point of view. I decided to listen but not challenge him politely<97>I could tell from his attitude that he was looking for an argument so that I could confirm his beliefs.

I'm going to be stuck in this glass chamber all day, in this heat and so will he,"" he said, pointing to his student, ""but I feel sorry for him: he has to drive all bloody day.""

I wondered if this man's philosophy on life placed him directly in the middle of his current misery. Feeling little sympathy for him at this point, I was looking forward to arriving at my bus stop. I thought about what negative thoughts and attitudes I held that made me miserable. I would need to be more aware of this in the future but, my stop was approaching.

The trainer then decided to share another of his views with me, that anyone with ""dark skin, slanty eyes or a straw hat had benefits handed out to them by the government and if you're white, ya get nothin'.""

It was then that any sympathy I had for him evaporated and all my sympathy was with the driver. I wished the driver ""Good luck"" as I stepped off the bus.

As I walked to work, I moved my mind to the coming week and all that I might achieve in my ""fancy air-conditioned office"". I felt good and am acutely aware that I have a lot to be thankful for: a beautiful family, a beautiful house, a steady job, and so much more. Today, however, I had one more thing to be thankful for<97>that I'm not learning how to drive a bus."
309,predicting-behaviour,Predicting Behaviour in Recruitment: A Magician's View,"A used <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/golden-rule-of-recruitment/"">golden rule of recruitment</a> is that past behaviour is an indication of future conduct. Businesses rely on reference checks or even Google searches to find out as much as they can about their potential new staff. But, is past behaviour a good proxy for predicting future behaviour?

Knowledge of the past is the foundation of all science and human understanding. We try to predict the future by drawing from our experience. Philosophers call this inductive process reasoning - drawing a general conclusion from a range of observations. But when you think profoundly about this, we can never know for sure that our past observations can be used to predict the future. Scottish philosopher <a title=""The Problem of Indiction"" href=""https://prevos.net/humanities/philosophy/induction/"">David Hume</a> did precisely this more than two centuries years ago when he found that it is not logical to think that past behaviour is an indication of future action.

For millennia people in Europe thought that all swans are white. This little kernel of absolute knowledge was rudely destroyed when in 1697 Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh was the first European to see a black swan in what is now Western Australia.

<h2>Predicting behaviour: A magician's view</h2>

The silent part of the American magician's duo <em>Penn &amp; Teller</em> broke his usual silence and vow of secrecy when he explained a classic magic trick to a gathering of consciousness scholars. Teller showed that magicians could use the propensity of the human mind to seek patterns by skilfully changing the method during the routine. Teller beautifully illustrates what Hume philosophically argued: in human behaviour, the past is in no way a reliable approach to predicting the future.

<h2>Predicting behaviour in recruitment</h2>

We have to be careful when judging a person through second-hand information gained from referees, Facebook searches and other forms of overt espionage. People are not billiard balls that operate by laws of physics. People have free will and can change their behaviour depending on the circumstances they find themselves in.

Most importantly, we can learn from our mistakes and grow as people by learning from them. Not hiring somebody who has made an error in the past could mean that you miss out on hiring an individual with a high level of maturity and ability to adapt. Therefore, when judging a person, keep in mind the words of Roman poet Horace:<a0><em>""Non sum quals eram</em>""<97>I am not who I once was."
300,consultant-shaman,The Consultant Shaman: Contemporary Rituals in Business,"Imagine you are an anthropologist, posted in a remote village in Papua New Guinea to study how people solve problems.

The village's yam crops have been reduced dramatically, and the village is on the brink of famine. Nobody knows what has caused the crop failures<97>the yams refuse to grow. One village elder says he has heard about a powerful shaman from a remote village in the mountains and wants to hire her to make sure they will not go hungry.

The shaman arrives, and everybody rejoices. She walks around the village, making strange noises, sniffing everything and dancing mysteriously. She announces to have found the cause and organises a long ritual that will remove the evil that creates crop failures. All the villagers gather and sing and dance all night. Everybody feels great. The next day they go back to working the fields, knowing that the cause for the crop failures has been neutralised. The following crop is plentiful, and the famine that was nearly upon them has been magically averted. Some years later you return to the village to revisit them. Most houses are gone, and people have moved away<97>recent crops failed, and everybody went to the city to look for work.

One of the executives says that she has heard about a management consultant from England and proposes to engage him in making sure they avoid insolvency.

The consultant arrives, and everybody is very confident. He goes to the organisation, asking questions and studies piles of documents. He announces to have found the cause of the reduced revenue and organises motivational sessions that will make things better. All employees gather, and they share many great ideas with each other. Everybody feels elated, and the next day they go back to work, knowing that the cause for potential financial disaster has been neutralised. Pretty soon, cash flow is positive again, and even a small profit is made. Some years later you return to the same building only to find a great ""For Rent"" sign on the door. The company recently went bankrupt after all.

Many managers believe that organising motivational team building sessions are sufficient to solve managerial problems. Employees are on the receiving end of an avalanche of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/theory-and-practice-of-management/"">management fads</a> and short-lived initiatives. A positive consequence of these types of sessions is that they can build strong personal relationships, which are essential for running an excellent organisation.

At the Lucid Manager, we believe in a rational approach, based on data, to solving the hard issues. Good quality data and statistical analysis, combined with strong human relationships are the only way to find solutions to hard problems. Having said this, acknowledging that human beings are not entirely rational, is paradoxically a sensible idea.

427,becoming-an-entrepreneur,Becoming an Entrepreneur: Walking Through the Valley of Darkness,"In Australia, the term <91><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/lessons-on-entrepreneurship/"">entrepreneur</a><92> has a very mixed heritage that may be responsible for discouraging others from embarking on a new enterprise. Bond and Skase are central to many Australians' view of an entrepreneur and they, Bond, Skase and Entrepreneurs are often cited with venomous derision; so much so that it has even generated the straight-to-video release of equally dubious movies such as <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264792/"">Let's Get Skase</a>.

Additionally, many Australians experience a sense of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"">schadenfreude </a>in watching successful public figures fall from grace, even going so far, at times, to assist their fall, in a cultural phenomenon known as the Tall Poppy Syndrome. The Tall Poppy Syndrome is a social levelling phenomenon, related to envy, that is well-known in Australia and New Zealand (Feather, 1989; Mouly and Sankaran, 2002).

Against the backdrop of failed entrepreneur pariahs and a social phenomenon acting to drag the successful toward mediocrity, it can be daunting for the inspired would-be Australian entrepreneur to act on their ideas; particularly because entrepreneurism, despite the bad press entrepreneurs may have received, is often a force for positive change within society.

<h2>Entrepreneurs as contributors</h2>

Understanding whether or not you would like to become an entrepreneur greatly depends on what being an entrepreneur means to the individual. The scholarly definition of entrepreneur and entrepreneurism has seen a significant evolution over time. Daniel Wren, in his excellent examination of the <em>History of Management Thought</em> (Wren, 2005: 42), describes the use of entrepreneur, or more literally the word 'undertaker' by Richard Cantillon in 1755 as anyone that bought or made a product at a certain cost to sell at an uncertain price. This definition encompasses almost all those engaged in any commercial enterprise.

Since Cantillon's definition, the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/essence-of-entrepreneurship/"">distinction between the entrepreneur and the manager</a> has further evolved, possibly as part of the academic drive to develop conceptual dichotomies. Entrepreneurs are seen as those that drive innovation whereas the manager is primarily engaged in imitation (White, 2004).

The view that the entrepreneur is a source of innovation is one presented and supported by the often-quoted and well-regarded Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, that the role of the entrepreneur is to drive creative destruction; that is, to reform or revolutionise (Petrakis, 2005; Turner, 2009). The necessity for entrepreneurial activity to be creative or innovative has also led to the conclusion that small business, previously thought to be synonymous with entrepreneurism, need not be entrepreneurial (Carland et al., 1984).

The role of the entrepreneur in creating jobs and consumer value has also been described in great detail, particularly by Peter Drucker who goes on to describe the activity of the entrepreneur as someone that always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity (Drucker, 1985: 28).

<h3>Entrepreneurs take on risks</h3>

When the activities of entrepreneurs are watched from afar though media reports it may appear that entrepreneurs are people that take on very large risks. This apparent propensity for taking on risk has been extensively described in the literature (for a summary see Petrakis, 2005). However, studies have not conclusively confirmed that entrepreneurs engage in greater levels of risk-taking behaviour than non-entrepreneurs (Brockhaus, 1980) and for a review and summary of other studies see Busenitz, 1999).

If entrepreneurs, successful or otherwise, make the decision to act upon their innovative ideas despite the prevailing depressed economic conditions, what can the non-entrepreneur learn from the experiences of entrepreneurs to gain the audacity to transition from non-entrepreneurship to entrepreneurship?

This essay seeks to examine two Australian entrepreneurs; Sidney Myer and William McPherson to argue that the prevailing economic conditions, boom or bust, provides an opportunity for the astute entrepreneur.

Additionally, it will be argued that lessons may be learnt from the two examples of entrepreneurs so that the non-entrepreneur may take that walk through the <91>valley of darkness<92> to emerge a successful entrepreneur on the other side.

<h3>Simcha Baevski (Sidney) Myer (1878<96>1934)</h3>

Simcha Baevski was born in Kritchev, Belarus, in 1878, the last of 11 siblings, his mother Koona Dubrusha who ran the family's drapery business and his Father, Israel, a scholarly Talmudist (Lifiman, 1999). After arriving in Australia in 1899, he adopted the name Sidney Myer and, with his brother Elcon, opened a small store in Bendigo, Victoria and began door-to-door sales of fabric and clothes to country housewives (Lifiman, 1999). His attitude, charm and enthusiasm, despite the initial language barrier, led to relatively rapid success and he moved his business to a larger store in Bendigo where he worked on building and improving the Myer Emporium.

He committed himself to world travel to make business contacts, understand emerging fashion trends and marketing methods and eventually took a large, but calculated risk in buying Moffat's Drapery in Melbourne (Anonymous, 1922). Sidney, coming from a background in which scholarly pursuits were valued, became a benefactor of educational and health facilities during the Great Depression and, being an amateur actor, he also became a great supporter of the arts (Lifiman, 1999). He was equally generous to his staff, providing paid holidays, staff share offerings and even providing an elaborate in-store hospital (Hyslop, 1986). He also established the Myer Woollen Mills in Ballarat to deal with difficulties with imports of some of his lines of products (Neil, 1920).

Following his untimely death in 1934 (Anonymous, 1934), Sidney Myer's legacy is one of courage and philanthropy and would most suitably fit within the Great Person school of entrepreneurism described by Cunningham and Lischeron (1991).

<h3>William Murray McPherson (1865<96>1932)</h3>

William McPherson was the son of an iron merchant who inherited his business concerns after his father's death in 1888 and his brother's death in 1896 (Patrick and Hamer, 1986). William received a six-year apprenticeship to a metal merchant and machinery import company prior to his inheritance, giving him a good understanding of that business. In later years he, among others, established the Acme Bolt Company which he owned outright by 1905 (Patrick and Hamer, 1986) which eventually became McPherson's Pty Ltd.

His educational and family background provided the basis for his entrepreneurial activities maintaining and growing the business during the Great Depression he did this through a shrewd business manner and an aversion to debt. Throughout his role as a businessman, he interviewed every job applicant and, after going on to serve as Treasurer, and subsequently Premier of Victoria. He ensured that his staff were treated well; providing them with lunch facilities, share offerings and bonuses at a time when this was uncommon (Patrick and Hamer, 1986). William McPherson's profile fits best with the Managerial School of entrepreneurism (Cunningham and Lischeron, 1991).

<h2>Defining Characteristics of Entrepreneurs</h2>

From the two case studies, and the observations of Peter Drucker (Drucker, 1985), it appears that change is the fuel of entrepreneurs. Though change is all surrounds us all of the time, it takes skill to identify the opportunities offered by that change. To be able to identify change, the above case study examples constantly searched it out. They believed in intellectual improvement and pursuits often travelling around the country or around the world to find new ideas and fresh perspectives.

It may be argued that being politically connected may also foster entrepreneurial activity, as William McPherson certainly had a very close affiliation with politics. This may provide the appearance that it's not what you know but who you know, it could be argued that politics is a profound source of change and being near to and in constant communication with the agents of change means that the entrepreneur is more likely to be able to identify a change in the general environment.

To respond to and exploit an opportunity, it is essential to have a great deal of support. The entrepreneurs above sought out that support from several sources to achieve their goals. They required a support network of families and friends to help guide their values, provide them with initial skills, give them encouragement during times of stress and to cheer them on when they were winning. They required the support of their customers, which they achieved by identifying their needs and meeting them with innovative or more efficient goods and services. They also depended on their staff to ensure that their customers are well looked after, and both Myer and McPherson demonstrated this example in their innovative approaches to valuing their staff. They also needed the support of the community in which they operate, and the aforementioned entrepreneurs are exemplars of not only corporate social responsibility but corporate social benevolence.

It is also possible that entrepreneurs identify and diagnose opportunity differently. While the research for two of the case studies cannot definitively provide an answer to how they identified an opportunity, in each case the next step was to be willing and able to act upon the findings of an opportunity diagnosis (Pech and Cameron, 2006). It is this willingness to take that leap of faith that requires the convergence of a number of factors based on personal attributes of the entrepreneur such as abilities, attitudes, skills and knowledge. It also required an understanding of the environmental obstacles and opportunity factors affecting the new venture such as cultural and community acceptance, social, political and environmental shifts, and resource availability (Pech, 2009).

<h3>Key differences between entrepreneurs</h3>

The two entrepreneurs cited above came from different educational backgrounds. One started his own enterprises while the other modified the activity of existing enterprises that was inherited. In one case there is a clear example of where the entrepreneur had a good understanding of the need for someone that complemented their own business skills; such as Lee Neil's management skills supporting Sidney Myer. It would appear that the differences outnumber the similarities, which may be of comfort to the non-entrepreneur looking toward embarking on an entrepreneurial enterprise.

<h2>Becoming an Entrepreneur</h2>

The decision to take the leap and become an entrepreneur is a daunting one, a walk through the valley of darkness as suggested in the title, but each successful entrepreneur has made this journey by being prepared with a map and a torch (a good understanding of their industry and customers), taking each small step at a time, surrounded by supportive family and friends, with enthusiasm for the journey itself.

For a non-entrepreneur to make the transition to entrepreneur, based on the case studies and literature cited in this essay, it is recommended that you start learning to think what no-one has thought yet to identify opportunities but then develop the decision-making skills to evaluate and then map out a way to bring ideas to life. This may be achieved by:

<ul>
    <li>Finding an opportunity that you are passionate about or develop a passion for the opportunity you find.</li>
    <li>Developing the abilities skills and knowledge necessary to run a business.</li>
    <li>Maintaining a high awareness of change and remain in frequent communication with change agents.</li>
    <li>Being aware of the actions of potential competitors.</li>
    <li>Enlisting the support of your loved ones and friends.</li>
    <li>Understanding your skills and limitations and partner with those that complement your skills.</li>
    <li>Planning and mapping out how you will develop the idea and then start the business; a business plan may assist this (Stutley, 2007).</li>
    <li>Starting small but plan to grow.</li>
    <li>Maintaining a lookout for new opportunities while remaining wary of new threats.</li>
    <li>Committing yourself to self-improvement and education and</li>
    <li>Being mindful of the support, you receive from your customers, staff and the community and ensuring that you provide support in return.</li>
</ul>

324,nepotism-in-the-workplace,The Virtues of Nepotism in the Workplace: Building strong organisations,"Nepotism in the workplace is considered by many to be one of the great sins of Western culture. Over the past century, Western society has been levelled by removing class distinctions and shaped to create equal opportunities for everybody, regardless of race, religion, gender. Family relationships are not supposed to play a role in any one's chances of success. The Wikipedia definition of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism"">nepotism</a> is:

<blockquote>Favouritism granted to relatives or friends, without regard to their merit.</blockquote>

When Ian and I researched <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/human-resource-management-in-hanoi/"">HR practices in Vietnam</a>, we came across thought-provoking recruitment practices. From our interviews with local managers, it became clear that using family networks is an accepted recruitment source for staff.

From our data, we formed the hypothesis that recruitment in countries with a collective nature, such as Vietnam, is primarily conducted through traditional social networks, not the electronic type. This collectivism contrasts with the developed world, with a high level of individualism, where, especially in the government sector, a level playing field is created by publicly advertising positions. Companies in Hanoi use family networks as a primary recruitment pool.

Although Vietnamese practices are very much like the dreaded nepotism in the workplace, some interviewees clarified that although they use family networks as a primary recruitment source, within that pool of people, the selection is nevertheless based on merit.

The benefit of this nepotism in the workplace is a strong organisational culture. A training manager of a large company told us that they have many teams in which several generations of one family work together and that this creates strong culture bonds and a sense of common purpose within the organisation.

<h2>Nepotism in the workplace</h2>

This sense of shared purpose is considered a holy grail by most organisations in the developed, individualistic, world. Many activities are aimed at 'aligning' people with the common objectives of the organisation. But given that most businesses are a grab bag of people, working together more by change than by common purpose, this has proven to be an elusive goal.

Research in Australia has shown that people recruited through anonymous sources such as newspaper advertisements missed almost twice as many days as those hired through other sources, such as employee referrals.[note]Breaugh, James A. (1981) Rela<ad>tion<ad>ship between recruit<ad>ing sources and employee per<ad>form<ad>ance, absent<ad>ee<ad>ism, and work atti<ad>tudes.<em> Academy of Man<ad>age<ad>ment Journal</em> 24(1): 142<96>147.[/note] This research underwrites the importance of using traditional social networks as a source of recruitment.

Human beings are inherently social creatures, and we like to spend our time with people we enjoy spending time with. Within that frame of reference, we are biased towards relatives. One of the primary reasons many people don't enjoy work is not because of the work itself but because of the people they are forced to socialise with.

<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">Open recruitment processes</a> aimed at creating a level playing field are problematic, and many organisations use abstract tools, such as <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">personality tests</a>, and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/predicting-behaviour/"">reference checks</a> to create the illusion that recruitment is a stoic rational process.

Next time when hiring people, look around your immediate and extended social circle and see if there is anybody you would like to work with that can potentially do the job. The moral of the story is: nepotism in the workplace is not inherently evil, as long as the final selection is based on merit."
18,deviant-behaviour,Positions Vacant: Deviant Behaviour is a Key Selection Criterion,"Would you like to work on the front lines of contemporary management?

The Lucid Manager is hiring, and we are looking for people that <strong>don't fit</strong> the culture of their current work and have difficulty being aligned with corporate goals. At the Lucid Manager, we believe that the only thing you have to be brought into line with is yourself.

We acknowledge that deviant behaviour and taking calculated risks is the foundation of innovation. We, therefore, look for independent critical thinkers who can add value.

If this were a genuine recruitment add, it would have been a very odd one indeed. Most companies are looking for so-called alignment and matching cultural values. At The Lucid Manager, we believe that this will lead to a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">severe lack of innovation</a>.

The major corporate collapses and scandals of the recent years have caused a tightening of corporate governance, and many organisations have moved away from open models of leadership that value self-initiative to more regimented models of management.

Even though the western world is waging war to spread democracy around the globe, the one aspect that dominates most people's lives, their workplaces, are ideally <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy"">meritocracies</a> but are mostly more like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship"">dictatorships</a>. Most organisations are managed through clear hierarchical lines, and people are not very likely to go against the grain.

<h2>Deviant Behaviour is neccesary</h2>

Research shows that employees do not only remain silent because of a fear of retribution but also because it is perceived as a <a href=""http://hbr.org/2010/06/debunking-four-myths-about-employee-silence/ar/1"">waste of their time</a>. This silence creates psychological tension and cognitive dissonance and eventually less commitment to organisational goals.[note]Detert, James R., Burris, E. R., &amp; Harrison, D. A. (n.d.). Debunking four myths about employee silence. <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, <em>88</em>(6), 26.[/note]

Organisational deviance is, however, a significant source of innovation. Without the freedom to make mistakes, there can be no learning. The current wave of tightened corporate governance leads to the silencing of dissenting voices and pruning of innovative actions. The ultimate consequence of this is the impoverishment of management practices."
488,esoteric-change-management,Esoteric Change Management: Marketing to change employees,"Just as a new house owner likes to change the paint colour, new businesses practice change management. The literature shows that most change management processes do not achieve the objectives they seek and a whole library of books has been written about the best ways to create and sustain change.

Managing change is more often than not about changing the behaviour of people. Management speak uses words such as alignment, creating buy-in and other <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2009/2706771.htm"">bendable learnings</a>. However, as soon as the word 'change' is mentioned in a workplace, people will raise their defensive shutters and try hard to keep doing what they have always been doing.

One aspect of management where attempts to change behaviour is very successful is marketing. Good companies can manipulate the attitudes and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/first-law-of-consumer-behaviour/"">behaviour of consumers</a> so that they buy their product. Why does it work in marketing but not so much in management?

Change management strategy is more often than not <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exoteric"">exoteric</a>. This perspective means that all details of the approach are revealed to the subjects of the change. Change managers, and more often than not <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consultant-shaman/"">consultants</a>, openly explain how they will change behaviour.

<h2>Esoteric change management</h2>

Marketing managers are a bit more devious about their motives and use <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/esoteric"">esoteric</a> change management techniques to change the behaviour of consumers. Some advertisements openly admit to the methods they use to change the behaviour of consumers - the best example is a <a href=""http://adland.tv/content/updated-molson-canadian-gets-touch-its-feminine-side-and-goes-plaid"">Molson beer ad</a> from some years ago:

<a href=""http://adland.tv/content/updated-molson-canadian-gets-touch-its-feminine-side-and-goes-plaid""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-6509"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2010/08/molsontwinad500B-1.jpg"" alt=""Reverse psychology is Molson beer advertisement."" width=""500"" height=""757"" /></a>

&nbsp;

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Maybe change managers should take a leaf from the book of marketing and use the sophisticated sociological and psychological techniques employed to convince people to change their buying behaviour.</p>

This might raise the question whether it is ethical to change people's behaviour esoterically. But all I have to say to that is that we change our behaviour based on our interaction with other people all the time. The anti-marketing crowd often underestimate the intelligence of consumers, which they portray as will-less victims. Creating change, whether in marketing or management is about creating an environment in which people feel comfortable to change, can identify with the proposed changes and believe that the change will provide them with benefits."

551,culture-change,The Pitfalls of Culture Change: Why most programs fail,"Culture change is a favorite past-time among contemporary managers. The promise that many management books make is that changing your organisation's culture will lead to organisational success.

Managers eager to impress their directors will invariably implement a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/esoteric-change-management/"">cultural change program</a> with the anticipation that it will increase <em>productivity</em>, <em>profitability</em> or any other noun ending in -ty. This promise first to change themselves on the premise that successful organisations all have a 'good' culture.

The idea that a good or healthy culture will improve business results is also logically nonsensical. The claim that a healthy organisational culture will improve performance is tautological. Any qualifier of the word culture will inevitably be self-referential.

<blockquote>Interestingly enough, most culture change programs fail!</blockquote>

The reason most cultural change programs fail is that culture is an epiphenomenon of human interaction, which means that culture as such does not exist. Culture is a mental construct; it is the <em>effect</em> of something and can not be the <em>cause</em> of anything. The only place where culture changes are always successful is in microbiological laboratories, where nerdy scientists in lab coats poke around in Petri-dishes and conical flasks to develop medicine, biological warfare or just because they need a job. Back to human cultures.

Culture is the result of a whole range of phenomena, such as people's values and beliefs. Managers more often than not focus on these aspects of culture. They try to change the values and beliefs of their staff by spouting 'inspiring' rhetoric and professional development programs. See our post on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consultant-shaman/"">consultants</a> for a view on this.

<blockquote>Culture is an epiphenomenon</blockquote>

Corporations are not democratic organisations and rely on hierarchical structures. Culture is thus driven from top to bottom and can therefore only change to the limit of the values and beliefs of the managers in charge. It is because of this that most textbooks on cultural change fail. To change a culture, managers need first to change themselves!

Because culture is the effect of phenomena, it can not be the cause of anything - including corporate success.[note]Pettigrew, Andrew M. On Studying Organizational Cultures. <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em> 24, no. 4 (1979): 570<96>581.[/note]

<h2>How to implement culture change</h2>

There are aspects of culture that can be modified quite easily. Other phenomena that cause culture are <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consultant-shaman/"">rituals and ceremonies</a>, stories and legends and material objects. This description might sound like things that you only find in tribal societies, but all corporations have them.

Rituals and ceremonies are expressed in the way meetings are conducted, and birthdays are celebrated and everything in between. Stories and legends relate to the history of the corporation, and material objects are the tools we use and the office we work in.

If a manager wants to change a 'culture', then these phenomena are the starting point. Change these, and the culture will follow. The best example to illustrate this is the often discussed Google offices. By placing people in the right environment, they will display the proper behaviour. <a href=""http://tribalinsight.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/supermarket-psychology/"">Supermarket designers</a> use these principles very successfully. Telling appropriate stories will create a sense of collective and conduct the corporate rituals in the right way will act as an example of the desired behaviour.

The simple message is: don't try to change a culture, try to modify the phenomena that cause the culture. Also, when implementing culture change, make sure you don't erase the creativejuices of the organisation by promoting <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/organisational-culture/"">normality</a> and fighting against <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">positive deviance</a>."
112,incompleteness-theorem-of-service-quality,The Incompleteness Theorem of Service Quality Measurement,"<!-- wp:paragraph -->
In 1931 Austrian mathematician Kurt G<f6>del formulated his famous '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems"">incompleteness theorem</a><92>, almost paradoxically proving that any system of mathematics can never be sufficiently established. The mathematical intricacies of this theorem are beyond contemplation for mere mortals, so I will leave them be.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
The incompleteness theorem does, however, not only hold for complex mathematical constructs and can also be applied to service quality measurement. The thus derived incompleteness theorem of service quality measurement states that:[note]An enhanced version of this idea will be presented at the <a href=""http://www.worldbusinesscapabilitycongress.com/"">World Business Capability Conference</a> in Auckland (December 2012).[/note]
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote"">Any effectively generated system capable of measuring service quality cannot be both <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency"">consistent</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_theory"">complete</a>.</blockquote>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Businesses often focus on their reporting on measurable performance indicators to report on service quality. The incompleteness theorem of performance management implies that in the delivery of a service, quality can never be measured thoroughly. Services are provided by and for people and every moment of the provision of services, every moment of truth, the situation is different due to the complexity of human behaviour which can not be captured in quantitative measures. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated a formal system of service quality measurement, some activities contribute to service quality but are not measured.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->

<h2>The Incompleteness Theorem of Service Quality</h2>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
The immediate reaction from supporters of the KPI movement and adherents of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/dumb-objectives/"">SMART targets</a> is that one must simply identify the right measures and enough of them to ensure the whole service is covered. However, the theorem holds that an enormous amount of KPIs are required to measure all aspects of a service. And if a service is measured completely, some KPIs will contradict each other as a system can not be complete and consistent at the same time. Thus, in line with G<f6>del's original work, a second theorem can be formulated:
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->

<blockquote class=""wp-block-quote"">The more aspects of a service are measured, the less efficient a service will be delivered.</blockquote>

<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

This condition will arise when customers are bombarded with feedback mechanisms. Staff spend a great deal of their time entering data and managers spend their days analysing numbers.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Don't get me wrong. Measurement is essential in business management. But we should not have the illusion that any data set can ever replace the intricate complexity of reality. Managers should never relinquish their critical thinking skills and move beyond the confines of rational data analysis. Service quality has an internal human dimension that goes <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-quality-index/"">beyond electronic dashboards</a> and graphs.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Embracing the qualitative nature of the provision of services and cultivate an understanding of interaction with customers is an essential ingredient to managing performance. This information might not be easily summarised and reported to boards, but the incompleteness theorem prevents us from doing much more. The incompleteness theorem of service quality aims to inspire managers to embrace the qualitative side of management.

728,management-tools,Welcome to the Matrix: A Methodology to Assess Management Tools,"The science of business, just like any other academic field of endeavour, seeks to understand the nature of reality. Scientists judge a theory not only on its ability to predict the future but also on whether it can be considered elegant. In the physical sciences, for example, Stephen Hawking admits that he longs for the day when nerds can wear t-shirts with a straightforward formula that explains everything in the universe.[note]Stephen Hawking (1988)<em> A Brief History of Time</em>.[/note]

<h2>The Science of Business</h2>

Business theorists are also drawn towards the aesthetics of their thoughts.[note]W.G. Astley, W. G. (1985) Administrative science as socially constructed truth. <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, 30: 497<96>513.[/note] The textbooks slaved over by MBA students all over the world are littered with two-dimensional matrices that purportedly explain everything from what business strategy to use or whether the divest whole business units.

It is a comforting thought that the unpredictable nature of business reality can be expressed in simple two-dimensional diagrams that even the least intelligent manager can reproduce to impress his peers and superiors with.[note]Matthew Stewart (2010). <em>The Management Myth: Debunking Modern business philosophy</em>. New York &amp; London: W. W. Norton.[/note]

Since I started my journey into business theory several years ago, it surprised me how much academic literature on business is separated from the popular books that managers read and apply in their daily work. A great moat surrounds the ivory tower of academic business schools. Most managers spend considerable time chewing the fat with academics when they attend university. But, as soon as they leave, there is little further interaction. The word academic is mostly used in a negative sense as an indication of something being of no practical use.

The Lucid Manager would not be a real business blog if we did not introduce our meta-matrix or <91><fc>ber-matrix<92> of the business sciences and management tools. So, let's take the blue pill and enter the world of the Management Theory Matrix, henceforth known as the LM (Lucid Manager) Matrix.

The first dimension of the LM Matrix is the extent to which theory is corroborated in reality. In other words, how much empirical evidence is available to support the theory. The second dimension to consider in the LM Matrix is the popularity of the theory. The popularity of a model can be easily tested by reviewing the best-sellers lists of internet bookshops and reviews in popular management magazines. To visualise the matrix and provide some metaphors, a zoological approach is used in the LM Matrix.

This method is inspired by the ubiquitous BCG Matrix and <a title=""Personality Profiling"" href=""http://www.thediscpersonalitytest.com"">DiSC personality profiling</a>. In the bestiary of business theories, we can distinguish four animal kingdoms, dodos, owls, rabbits and unicorns, each with their unique characteristics.

<h2>Management Tools Matrix</h2>

<h3>Dodos</h3>

When a management theory has a shallow empirical foundation and is neither very popular, it can be called a dodo. Just like the now extinct ugly flightless bird from the island nation of Mauritius was hunted to extinction by Dutch sailors in the seventeenth century, these theories are not able to withstand the evolutionary forces of social selection by managers and scholars. Although the father of what we now call management science, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/frederick-taylor-management-fundamentalism/"">Freddy Taylor</a>, who himself was killing the dodos of his time, proclaimed to base his work on rigorous measurements of reality. More recent research of his private notes shows that this is more myth than reality. See Matthew Stewart's excellent book <em><a href=""http://mwstewart.com/the-management-myth/"">The Management Myth</a></em>, which inspired to write this post. Taylorism and Scientific Management is thus an example of a dodo. Although it has spawned many modern theories, Taylor's original thought has fortunately perished.

<h3>Owls</h3>

Academic journals of management theory are brimming with valuable research, carefully undertaken and analysed using deep thought and sophisticated mathematical models. Prestigious journals rigorously select papers that can demonstrate a high level of empirical validation and predictive power. The complexity of academic thinking is, however, not popular with managers. Most people in business are not comfortable with convoluted mathematics and abstract structures proposed by scholars. The ancient Greek goddess of wisdom Athena is often depicted with an owl perched on her head. These theories are as such called owls because of their great wisdom. Alas, owls are shy creatures that prefer the darkness of the night and are rarely seen in boardrooms and management workshops.

<h3>Bunnies</h3>

Most theories that win the popularity contest in the business ideas market dramatically<a0>lacking in empirical validation. Managers blindly accept Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as a psychological truth and try to emulate the <a href=""http://www.quickmba.com/mgmt/7hab/"">7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>. They are called bunnies because they are cute and cuddly on the outside, but breed uncontrollably and can cause irreparable damage to the environment; burrowing holes and undermining the foundations of organisations. Some authors, such as Jim Collins and his immensely popular book <em>Good to Great</em>, hide behind a veil of pseudoscience and undertake shallow research without the statistical rigour required in science. But his work is littered with tautologies and is lacking in critical analysis.

<h3>Unicorns</h3>

What would be expected the Cash Cow of management theory are those ideas that are corroborated with actual business practice and are indeed practised widely, are unfortunately as elusive as the mythical unicorn. But the unicorn stands for a hope of better times ahead. Maybe one day a new age in business will e heralded, as was initially proclaimed by Taylor, and millions of workers around the world can sigh of relief when they are liberated from the dodos and owls, instead of riding unicorns towards the rainbow.

<h2>Epilogue</h2>

But what does this all mean you might ask yourself. The simple message that the LM Matrix proclaims is, in the words of Immanuel Kant: ""<em>Sapere Aude</em>!"", or in everyday language, dare to think.

A business theory is, in essence, social theory, and no aspect of reality is so difficult to capture in theory as the behaviour of human beings. Good business science is complicated and often requires deep thought and self-knowledge to be able to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verstehen"">understand</a> business. As a social science, a business can not be explained away in simple theories and matrices. Understanding comes with wisdom and insight that can just not be drawn in two-dimensional diagrams."
885,sociological-imagination-in-marketing,Do You Know Your Customers? Sociological Imagination in Marketing,"Customers are the lifeblood of any organisation. Marketing is, very simply put, the process of creating customer satisfaction or in the words of Philip Kotler, ""customer satisfaction engineering"".[note]Kotler, P., &amp; Levy, S. J. (1969). Broadening the concept of marketing. <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, <em>33</em>, 10<96>15.[/note]

To be able to market well it is as such extremely important to know who this other person is and understand their needs and wants. In the words of my former marketing professor Rhett Walker, you need to find out what ""rattles their cage"".

Marketers mainly do this by using simplified quantitative models of social reality. They like to know where customers live, who their customers are, how they purchase and use stuff and why they buy stuff in the first place. Like a baby playing with blocks, they match the segments with their products and services, making sure not to put a square peg in a round hole. Selling ice to Eskimos is clearly a case of segmentation gone horribly wrong.

It is tough to make sense out of the myriad of variables available within the four broad types of segmentation. But people's drive to simplify the complexity of social reality knows no bounds. Some companies have developed excellent tools to help marketers to segment their market in easy to understand chunks, such as the <a href=""http://www.roymorgan.com/products/values-segments/values-segments.cfm"">Roy Morgan Values Segments</a> and the VALS<a0> (Values, Attitudes and LifeStyles) system. Unfortunately, these systems are propriety, and it is difficult to assess their validity, but that does not diminish their <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-tools/"">popularity</a>. You can even do the <a href=""http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/surveynew.shtml"">VALS survey online</a> and find out what your primary and secondary type is. It only takes 39 simple questions to classify every human being into neat categories.

<h2>Sociological imagination in marketing</h2>

These systems certainly serve a purpose, but they can be no replacement for a real understanding of human beings. To be a successful marketer requires <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sociological_Imagination"">sociological imagination</a> which is the ability to recognise relationships between patterns in society and the actions of individual people. The quantitative sociology of segmentation cannot lead to an understanding of people, it can only describe them. Understanding is much harder to obtain. In the words of C. Wright Mills:[note]C. Wright Mills (1959)<em> Sociological Imagination</em>. Oxford University Press, London.[/note]

""Neither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be understood without understanding both"".

Sociological imagination in marketing is a quality of mind, rather than analysing a set of data. Unfortunately, this type of knowledge cannot be summarised in beautiful diagrams nor can it be scientifically tested with statistical models. Sociological imagination in marketing is a narrative that grows through debate and life experience.

To truly understand customers you need to look beyond the source of revenue with a multitude of labels, but understand them in a qualitative sense. You need to find out what rattles their cage."
906,managers-new-clothes,The Manager's New Clothes: The Magic of the Business Suite,"The manager in his or her suit has become an archetype in professional life around the globe. Even at international meetings, where people of various cultures gather, managers all wear the same type of clothing, only displaying minor variations in style and colour.

Business suits have of course no practical purpose but instead, convey social meaning. The suit has become a symbol of power, and a means to demarcate the white from the blue collars. Using clothes and other objects to communicate meaning to other people is a natural aspect of being human. An immutable law of marketing is that we don't buy stuff for what it does, but for what it means.

Early in my career, I was working on a dredging site in Bangladesh, wearing my comfy heavy metal t-shirt and jeans. I was unexpectedly asked to present to head office executives visiting from the Netherlands. Blissfully unaware of my lack of appropriate attire and ignoring their visible scepticism towards my expertise I was able to convince them of my recommendation.

It is of course not a secret that the relationship between the clothes we wear and our actual ability to be a good manager is not a necessary one. Sociologists Erving Goffman, who analysed human interaction from a theatrical perspective, wrote more than half a century ago:

<blockquote>People holding corporate positions are blinding themselves and others to the fact that they hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.[note]Erving Goffman (1959) The presentation of self in everyday life<em>, Penguin, London.[/note]</em></blockquote>

In the field of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/first-law-of-consumer-behaviour/"">consumer behaviour</a>, the clothes we buy are often seen as the <em>result</em> of our lifestyle, demographics and other variables. Sociologists, however, have a reverse logic and look at the clothes we wear as the <em>cause</em> of the behaviour. Research has confirmed that we use objects such as clothing to compensate for actual ability to act in a particular role.

It has been found that MBA students less likely to be successful in professional life (based on grade averages) are more likely to look the part.[note]Solomon, Michael R.: The Role of Products as Social Stimuli: A Symbolic Interactionism Perspective, <em>The Journal of Consumer Research</em> 10(3), volume 10, 319<96>329, 1983.[/note]

<h2>Management's New Clothes</h2>

With this in mind, it is interesting to note that quite often the smartest people are portrayed in movies as eccentric, deviating from the expectations, but accepted because of their abilities.

Clothing as a means to communicate actual and aspired social status is part of what makes us human, and after my experience, I quickly learnt to adapt to the expectations of professional life. The best way to end this post is with the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-management/"">words of the bard</a>:

972,alternative-risk-matrix-template,The Risk of Risk Management: An Alternative Risk Matrix Template,"If Einstein were a management guru, he perhaps would have said that managers don't play dice, but how wrong he was! All of management is about controlling risk. If there were no risk, there would be no need to manage anything because positive outcomes would be guaranteed.

<blockquote>God doesn't play dice but managers do.</blockquote>

Risk management is a complex topic that is all about the dreaded concept of statistics. Most managers don't understand statistics and need something simple to help them through the necessary risk management sessions. They use a risk management template to make the topic understandable for the not so mathematically inclined.

Around the world, businesses are using simple matrices to manage risk. People gather around a table and argue whether a risk is low, medium or high. In most cases without proper consideration of the actual statistical issues.

Risk matrices are a poor proxy for real risk management and suck up a lot of resources to 'manage' trivial risk.[note]Cox, L.A. (2008), <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18419665"">What's Wrong with Risk Matrices</a>?, <em>Risk Analysis</em>, (28)2: 497-512.[/note] Risk matrices provide false confidence in the actual risk profile and, more often than not, produce outcomes that do not add any information to the situation other than the ability to provide colourful overviews. The best outcome of any risk matrix exercise is that at least all risks have been discussed and acknowledged. The actual outcome of the matrix rarely has any bearing on the way the risk is managed; it is merely a category.

A risk matrix is a security blanket for higher management and the board to feel secure that the rest of the organisation knows what they are doing and will not expose the organisation to unacceptable risks.

984,service-with-a-smile-mirror-neurons,Service With a Smile: The Function of Mirror Neurons,"Service with a smile is one of the most famous mantras in customer service, possibly only second to ""<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-perception/"">the customer is always right</a>"". The requirement for service providers to smile is a practical wisdom that is intuitively true.

Sceintists have confirmed this practical wisdom and they have linked genuine smiles to increased customer satisfaction and repurchase intentions.[note]Sandra Gountas, Michael T. Ewing, John I. Gountas (2007), Testing airline passengers' responses to flight attendants' expressive displays: The effects of positive affect. <em>Journal of Business Research</em> (60) 81<96>83.[/note]

Responding positively to smiles is part of our mind's software. When we see somebody provides service with a smile, your <a title=""Mirrror Neurons"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"">mirror neurones</a> are activated. These neurons form part of the same pathway as the neurons that we use when we smile. In other words, seeing somebody smile activates the same parts of the brain we use when we smile ourselves. These neurons are the scientific explanation of why smiles are so contagious and why being around happy people makes us feel happy as well.

Many managers are aware that smiling staff increases their chances of achieving business objectives. However, some managers do not fully understand the theory and try to coerce their employees to smile. They post written reminders on kitchen walls to remind their employees to provide service with a smile.

These managers know that they work in a theatre and segregate the 'front stage' from the 'backstage' employees, who are are actors in play. Forcing people to smile is not very effective and can create a lot of <a title=""Emotional Labour"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_labor"">emotional labour</a>. There is, however, an effortless and cost-effective way to make sure your staff treat their customers very well.

The most effective and cheapest way to make your staff smile is by smiling at them and provide a fun workplace where people feel free to joke with each other.[note]Managers with a ""STAR"" in their <a title=""Personality Test"" href=""http://www.lucidmanager.org/free-personality-test"">personality inventory</a> will find it easier to behave this way.[/note] Why not use the same principle of psychology you want to use on staff on your employee. Smile at you staff will make the smile. No need for expensive customer service seminars and propaganda, just being nice to your staff is the best investment a manager can make. Only genuine smiles will provide a genuine service with a smile."

Play this game at your next meeting,"Managers use an <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/theory-and-practice-of-management/"">esoteric language</a> to describe very common activities. Anyone who works in an office will have heard some of the weasel words and buzzwords around the meeting table. Some of these words use evocative metaphors to express something quite mundane.

1017,misdirection-in-presentations,Misdirection in Presentations: What Managers can learn from Magicians,"In a blog entry for <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, Jerry Weissman argued that <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/06/misdirection_is_for_magicians.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">misdirection is for magicians, not for presenters</a>. Weissman writes that misdirection has no place in business presentations because a presenter needs to direct the attention of the audience to the screen, not distract it as a magician does.

While distracting your audience is indeed not a good presentation technique, managers can learn from magicians to perform better presentations. Business people that perform magic have been found to be better public speakers than other presenters.[note]Davids, Meryl. <93>Tricks of the Trade.<94> <i>The Journal of Business Strategy</i> 15, no. 3 (1994): 67.[/note] This article shows how the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/magic-of-marketing/"">methods used by magicians</a> are also useful for business presentations.

<h2>Misdirection in the Office</h2>

Misdirection is one of the few words of the specialist magician's vocabulary that have made it into everyday speech.[note]A. S. Fleischman (1949), Words in modern magic, <em>American Speech</em> (24)1, pp. 38<96>42.[/note] Misdirection is an essential technique in sleight of hand conjuring used to ensure that the audience cannot identify the causes of the actions of the magician. While the magician hides a ball in her left hand, she focuses the attention of the audience on her right hand so that the ball remains outside the field of awareness of the spectator. Some magicians no longer use the term misdirection but prefer 'attention management' to indicate that that the audience is directed towards the narrative of the magic trick instead of the technique.

Techniques to distract people from the real cause of things is not only used by magicians but in all forms of the performing arts. Some scholars even argue that misdirection is an essential skill in everyday human interaction.[note]Erving Goffman (1959), <em>The performance of self in everyday life</em>, Anchor Books.[/note] Erving Goffman described the interaction between humans as a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-management/"">theatrical metaphor</a> and emphasised the importance of managing the impressions that people have of each other.

Goffman writes that we are all actors in a play of our own making; we have scripts, props and costumes to portray how we want the outside world to perceive us. We require misdirection in our daily and professional lives to construct who we are by our ideal self. One of the ways professionals communicate their corporate positions communicate is through clothing and managers are, according to Goffman:

<blockquote>... blinding themselves and others to the fact that they hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.</blockquote>

Misidrection is as such a normal aspect of our lives and probably more so in the office. Working life is an artificial reality where people wear uncomfortable clothes to misdirect the attention away from their true self. Goffman's ideas might seem a pessimistic interpretation of human interaction, but deception is part of life because social reality is subjective.

The manager has become an archetype of contemporary society. The manager is the prime example of <em>homo economicus</em>, the rational thinking problem solver that always seeks to maximise benefit, independent of social reality. This thought is, however, only an ideal that many of us strive to and we all play a role in the great theatre of life.

<h2>Misdirection in Presentations</h2>

Business presentations are a form of theatre even more so. Brief monologues designed to convince the listener that the presenter's ideas should be implemented. Misdirection is a valid and natural way to create the ideal self of the lucid manager and persuade people with your presentations. This post is, however, not an invitation to deceive in business presentations. Misdirection only works when it is subtle and skillfully applied.

Public speaking fills many people with fear. Jerry Seinfeld once joked that:

<blockquote><93><85> people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. This strong statement means to the average person that if you have to go to a funeral, you are better off in the casket than doing the eulogy<94>.</blockquote>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ6giVKp9ec

A good presenter needs to manage the attention of the audience away from the unimportant aspects of their presentation and focuses the listener on on the narrative.

In the <em>Powerpoint</em> era, beautifully designed slides can be used to give credence to an otherwise weak argument. The summarised and seemingly well-flowing information hides gaps in knowledge and insecurities of the presenter.

&nbsp;

For professionals, public speaking is an essential skill which unfortunately not many of them excel at. We all have sat through <em>death by Powerpoint</em>; bombarded with slides and poorly presented disjointed information.

<h2>What Managers can learn from Magicians</h2>

In my opinion, presentation skills are essential to succeed in any organisation<97>business presentations are a form of theatre. In this post, I will explain how a book favorite among magicians<97><a title=""The Five Points of magic by Juan Tamariz"" href=""http://www.penguinmagic.com/p/6970"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Five Points of Magic</a> Spanish performer Juan Tamariz<97>can be used to teach professionals about presentation skills.[note]Russian magician <a title=""Communication workshops by Manuel Llaser"" href=""http://www.llasermagic.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Manual Llaser</a> uses the Five Points principle in corporate training.[/note] Below are some tips from the book that apply to both magicians and public speaking.

<h3>1. The Eyes</h3>

Eye contact is the most vital tool to connect with the audience. Don't only look at the first row. Sweep your gaze like a fan across the spectators, giving everybody some personal attention.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-3609"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2012/12/tamariz-eyes.jpg"" alt=""Public speaking - eye contact"" width=""515"" height=""185"" />

<h3>2. The Hands</h3>

The hands are the most critical tool of the magician, and in business presentations, they usually perceived get in the way. But the hands can communicate almost anything. We should use our hands to point out things, present objects and emphasise the communication. Think about how you use your hands other than a means to hold your laser pointer.

<h3>3. The Voice</h3>

Imagine an elderly lady, who is hard of hearing, sitting at the back of the room. Dedicate the performance to her and project your voice to the last row.

<img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-2971"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2012/12/tamriz-mouth.jpg"" alt=""Public speaking - project your speech"" width=""924"" height=""404"" />

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<h3>4. The Feet</h3>

The best place to stand is centre stage, facing the audience. Don't hide behind the lectern or turn your back to the audience. This positioning is essential to be able to make good eye contact.

<h3>5. The Body</h3>

Body language is our subconscious means of communication. In theatre, and thus also in public speaking, we need to be aware of this type of communication.

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

This post is only a glimpse into the vast array of literature on theatrical performances that can be applied to public speaking.

Next time you need to do a presentation, view it as a theatrical performance and follow the five points of public speaking.

One last tip: whatever you do, never <a title=""Presenting to a naked audience"" href=""http://jeffzelaya.com/imagine-that-the-audience-is-completely-naked/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">imagine your audience naked</a>, at best it will get you distracted.

1026,management-world-cup,The Management World Cup: Are Americans world champion managers?,"Management has become a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/globalisation-and-converging-commonality/"">global game,</a> and an intrinsic part of human nature is to compare countries with one another. A group of European researchers have determined that through, as they describe it themselves, ""painstaking research"", that the United States of America is the winner of the management world cup.

The research is based on the <a title=""Worl Management Survey"" href=""http://worldmanagementsurvey.org/"">World Management Survey</a>, a questionnaire to benchmark companies on an international scale. This benchmarking is, however, based on American management practices, so it is no wonder that the country from which these practices originate applies them best.

Among the practices considered world-class, such as Lean Manufacturing, sound intuitively sound, but have caused much pain for managers around the world. The number of companies implementing these systems and getting no return on investment would most likely outweigh the ones where these types of formalised improvement drives have provided benefits.

<h2>Management World Cup make sense?</h2>

In our <a title=""HR in Hanoi"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/human-resource-management-in-hanoi/"">research in Hanoi</a>, we found that there exist distinct practices in Vietnam, a country that is running a hugely successful economy. We also saw a keen interest in Vietnamese translations of American textbooks into Vietnamese. We concluded that recognition of Vietnamese Human Resource Management is needed to alleviate the need to introduce models from the USA, which have shown to be not always successful.

In my management experience, the existence of cultural conflict indicates that international practices cannot be imported without risk. Management is an inherently human activity, and management practices have to fit the cultural background in which they are conducted. This condition makes the whole concept of a World Cup of management an empty idea as the comparison between countries will always be ideologically rooted.

The Management World Cup is a form of cultural imperialism that suggests that there is one perfect way to manage an organisation succesfully. The pluriformity of organisational culture suggests that it does not make sense to apply one approach across the globe. A Lucid Manager understand the intricate relatinship between culture and management and finds ways to adapt to the local situation."
1031,magic-of-marketing,The Magic of Marketing | What do Marketing and Magic have in Common?,"What do marketing and conjuring have in common? Some might say that both fields of human endeavour use deception to reach their objectives. Marketers promise a world in which consumers can be beautiful and live the life of the rich and famous. Magicians deceive by presenting a world in which spectators are asked to believe that the laws of nature can be suspended. Marketers and magicians have, however, more in common than the creation of impossible worlds of universal beauty and magic. There are in fact four areas where magic shows and marketing overlap. I got this insight when watching Australian magician <a href=""http://www.simoncoronel.com/"">Simon Coronel</a> and his show <em>Manipulations</em>.

<h2>Magic Techniques in Marketing</h2>

<h3>Special techniques</h3>

Firstly, to be able to create the illusion of perfect or enchanted worlds, both marketers and conjurers need to use <em>special techniques</em>, hidden from consumers and spectators. Magicians spend many hours developing manual dexterity to create the illusion of magic. Marketers use special techniques to, for example, create the illusion that food looks fresh, even after ours in the spotlight of a photo studio.

<h3>Perception Psychology</h3>

The use of <em>perception psychology</em> is the second correspondence. Most stage illusions are, just like advertisements, based on the fact that our mind makes inferences based on perceptual clues. We are led to believe that beautiful girls can be cut in half and restored just like we are led to believe that using the right deodorant will make you more attractive.

<h3>Attention Management</h3>

Penultimate, both marketers and magicians, use <em>attention management</em>. These are psychological tools to ensure that consumers remember advertisements or that spectators only looks at the narrative aspects of the performance. In conjuring, this is mostly called misdirection, which is the technique to ensure viewers do not perceive the mechanical workings of a trick. In marketing, this is important because in a hyper-competitive world attracting attention from consumers is tough.

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

Finally, <em>presentation and entertainment</em> are essential in both conjuring and marketing. Both are forms of theatre. A well-designed shop, website, supermarket and so on are similar<a0>to a stage. The most successful brands in the world understand and excel at this. The most important aspect of a magic performance or a marketing exchange is that the consumer has a positive experience.

<h2>The Magic of Marketing and Deception</h2>

Theatrical magic is based on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/magician-manager/"">deception</a>, using the four principles outlined above. Using deception in marketing is considered unethical while using deception in a magic show is accepted. There exists a social contract between the magician and the audience that deception will be used to entertain them. But also in marketing, there is an implicit understanding by consumers that communication paints a positive picture and does not provide the whole truth. Just like a magician does not reveal the secrets, neither does a marketer point out the negative aspects of their offering.

<h2>Selling Magic</h2>

The art of retail has one of the strongest links between theatre ad marketing. All <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/retail-theatre/"">retail is<a0>deceptive theatre</a> in its core. Not only as a metaphor but as a means to sell more product. One of the most visible connections between magic and marketing are the many brand names with the word magic in it. As I aimlessly walked around a shopping centre, I came across the <em>Magic Mop Set</em>, a mop so good that it will clean the floors like magic.

A search in the <a title=""American trademark register"" href=""http://www.uspto.gov/"">American trademark register</a> reveals more than three thousand entries that use the word magic. A company producing herbal nutritional supplements uses <em>Jungle </em><em>Magic </em>to communicate the idea that their herbs have properties beyond the natural garden herbs. Prepaid telephone cards are marketed as <em>It's Magic </em>to express their ease of use, and a series of cooking appliances sell under the name of <em>Cook Magic </em>which seems to suggest that cooking with these products becomes an effortless activity.

Using the word magic in the branding of goods and services taps directly into the almost universal human desire for a magical world where mundane activities can be undertaken virtually effortlessly. Marketing, just like a magic show, delivers the promise of a world where the bonds of the laws of nature have been broken.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Buying magical products taps into a sincere desire for a world where we control reality, instead of being controlled by it.</p>

1074,retail-theatre,Retail Theatre | The Fundamental Principle of Brick and Mortar Shops,"Retailers around the world are scratching their heads how to seduce customers to come back into their shops. Financial woes and competition from online stores have seen a decline in retail turnover. In Australia, some shopkeepers even criticised their customers because they prefer to purchase their goods online. Online retailers indeed have a price advantage over local retailers, but the real cause of why people prefer to shop online lies, however, more profound than price alone.

Since my undergraduate days, I enjoy smoking the occasional cigar. Retailing tobacco has its complexities, given the health implications of excessive smoking. The marketing principles governing their sales are, however, the same.

My favourite cigar shop is located in my former hometown of Maastricht in the Netherlands and is owned by cigar aficionado Wum Otten. At my first visit to his shop, I was fascinated by the thousands of boxes and smoking paraphernalia lining the walls. I asked Wum for my then favourite brand, but he quickly persuaded me to try something different. He shuffled around the boxes and produced a single cigar for me to try. Ever since that first visit, I have faithfully bought almost all my cigars from his shop, until I moved to Australia.

Being thousands of kilometres away from my favourite cigar store, I am faced with the boring tobacco shops in Australia. Alas, I purchase my cigars online as the places available to me do not know the product and do not provide a compelling experience. The shops are dull - only partially caused by strict anti-smoking legislation - and staff are unmotivated. Buying cigars is no longer an enjoyable experience, so I prefer the utility of online shopping.

<h2>Retail Theatre as a Metaphor and as a Reality</h2>

The idea of providing an <em>experience</em> is a moern development of marketing. Retail has been compared with a theatrical experience.[note]See for example Kim Harris, Richard Harris and Steve Baron (2001) <a href=""http://0-proquest.umi.com.alpha2.latrobe.edu.au/pqdweb?index=0&amp;did=229185481&amp;SrchMode=1&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=4&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1310650728&amp;clientId=20828"">Customer participation in retail service: Lessons from Brecht</a> <em>International Journal of Retail &amp; Distribution Management</em> (29)8/9: 359-370.[/note] Retail theatre relies on correspondences between shopping and the stage: the backdrop and props formed by retail displays and merchandise with salespeople as actors, customers as spectators and the shop floor is the stage. A salient difference between a shop and a theatre is that there is no <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall"">fourth wall</a>, no imaginary sheet of glass between the actors and the spectators and no <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscenium"">proscenium</a>. The customers are not just passive spectators but are active and integral components of the play.

Therein also lies the most significant difference between online retailing and brick-and-mortar shops. Online retailing engages the eyes and maybe the ears, but physical retailing provides a full sensory and social experience. Online stores have no smell; you can not touch the goods. There are also no people, which is negative but is often considered a positive.

Well designed physical shops with motivated staff provide a holistic experience that can only be beaten by online retailers on price and many case studies in marketing show that price is only one factor in purchase decisions. Recent research indicates that a positive mood, influenced by motivated retail staff and a vibrant environment, have a positive impact on shopping behaviour.[note]Paul M. Herr, Christine M. Page, Bruce E. Pfeiffer and Derick F. Davis (2012) Affective Influences on Evaluative Processing, <cite>Journal of Consumer Research</cite> (Published online 13 June 2011).[/note] All the more reason for retail managers to look at their shop as a theatre and positively influence the customer experience."
1195,complaints-are-a-gift,Customer complaints are a gift: Collect as many as you can,"One Monday morning Jeff came to work, preparing for a new week on the phone and helping customers. His day way rudely interrupted when his manager summoned him and scolded Jeff about a customer complaint that had come to his attention. Jeff went back to his workstation, angry and disenchanted: ""bloody customers!""

The ultimate aim of any organisation is to create gains for shareholders by providing value to customers. To be able to achieve this purpose it is imperative that a business <a title=""How well do you know your customers?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/sociological-imagination-in-marketing/"">understands customers</a>. It is impossible<a0>always to keep every single customer satisfied, and complaints are an inevitable outcome of trying to help people.

<blockquote>The customer is always right about their own perception of the value they receive.</blockquote>

On the bright side, complaints are a source of information that is not always fully appreciated by managers. The customer is always right about their perception of the value they receive and a complaint provides a great insight into how customers perceive what you do. In many organisations, the number of complaints is seen as a negative indicator. When a customer lodges a formal expression of dissatisfaction, managers run around in blind panic and try to found out who is to blame for this negative experience.

McDonald's seemed to have grasped that complaints are a gift and created this beautiful pieces of advertising.

<h2>Customer complaints are a gift</h2>

McDonald's are not the only fast food company performing a <em>mea culpa</em> on television. Also pizza purveyor Domino's recently admitted having changed its recipe after customer feedback. Patrick Doyle, president of Dominoes, summarised their journey succinctly: ""You can either use negative comments to get you down, or you can use them to excite and energise you"".

The moral of this story is to embrace customer complaints.If a customer complaints about a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/fly-in-my-soup/"">fly in the soup</a>, perhaps it is actually a crouton. A lucid manager leaves emotions out of the equation and rationally analyses every complaint and seeks ways to improve the organisation without finger pointing and enabling your staff to help their customers. Follow Ian's <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/complaint-management/"">Five Steps of Complaint Management</a>."
1304,complaint-management,Don't want to be *that* guy<97>Five Steps of Complaint Management,"I know that you would rather shuffle self- consciously near the service counter and try to pretend you have nothing to do with <em>that</em> guy.

That guy is standing there outlining, somewhat passionately, just how disappointed he is that, as a customer, his expectations have not been met. It's almost a reflex that most of us don't want to be part of the conflict in any way. Many would just take their business elsewhere; it's bad enough to be near <em>that</em> guy, imagine being him!

Some companies might, somewhat rudely, label <em>that</em> guy a complainer. Complaining, however, is merely a description of what he is doing. He should be viewed by the business as Santa Claus bringing the gift of opportunity.

Rather than walk away, quietly taking his money with him, he is providing critical marketing intelligence <em>and</em> providing a golden opportunity to turn some very negative word-of-mouth publicity into a clear positive message.
<blockquote>If you've misinterpreted their concerns, empathise!</blockquote>
We all have stories of companies who have done a bad job of ""Service Recovery"". I recently became <em>that</em> guy when a local company failed to do what they promised to do for a member of my family. After sending a written complaint, the manager of the company called and asked to meet with me and what I experienced was service recovery done the right way.

A <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/complaints-are-a-gift/"">complaint is a gift to the business</a> and every manager should embrace the opportunities they provide.
<h2>Complaints Management</h2>
The way that this manager handled the meeting provides an excellent template of how to deal with a customer's complaint in a way that, in most cases, will lead to customer satisfaction and excellent word-of-mouth endorsement. The five steps that he used were:
<h2>1. Thank the customer for making the complaint</h2>
It's likely that the customer will feel awkward. It is easy to say, ""Thank you for telling us about this problem, most people would have, just left but you've given us the chance to fix this problem, not only for you but for other customers."" Being thanked for making a complaint is often surprising for the customer but helps them feel more open to discuss the problem.
<h2>2. Outline your understanding of the problem</h2>
While simple, this lets the customer know that you have heard their complaint and allows them to correct you if you've misinterpreted their concerns; empathise! Show them that you understand the impact on the customer.
<h2>3. Take personal responsibility for fixing the problem</h2>
This is a tough one to do. While you might not feel that you personally are at fault, the customer will often need someone to be accountable for fixing the problem. A simple approach is to say, ""I could have made sure that my staff were aware that this approach may caused you and I didn't do that well enough on this?occasion?- I take personal responsibility for fixing this problem""
<h2>4. Negotiating an agreed approach to fixing the problem</h2>
In most cases, this could be simple. A refund, a next free visit, an apology. It is also vital that you outline how to ensure that the problem does not happen again. During this step, it is essential that you gain an acceptance from the customer that the solution is agreed upon and that it will resolve their concerns.
<h2>5. Do what you promised to do to fix the problem!</h2>
Whether you actually deliver on your promise to fix the problem or not the customer <em>will</em>?tell others. By delivering on the promise, you get to choose positive word-of-mouth endorsement and much higher levels of customer satisfaction. I'll leave it to your imagination what stories will be told if you don't deliver.

Customer service engineering may still be, in the larger part, more art than science. It is important to bear in mind that ""individual results may vary"" but taking the?five steps to customer service recovery very much increases the odds that you'll turn <em>that</em>?guy into one of your company's best resources."
1327,fly-in-my-soup,"<93>Waiter, there is a fly in my soup<94> <97> When Customer Service Goes Wrong","<em>Customers are always right</em> is one of the adages often proclaimed in marketing. This well-worn phrase was coined by Harry Gordon Selfridge, Sr. (1864<96>1947), a retail magnate and founder of the British department store Selfridges. Lucid managers object against this presumed absolute truth because <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/balanced-centricity/"">bowing to every whim</a> of customers would make it very hard to achieve organisational goals, i.e. to provide a return to shareholders or help as many people as possible in the case of social marketing.

Some might hold that the customer is always right about their perception, but that is a far too simplistic view of this problem. This statement needs to be unpacked and analysed to find it what it means. There are three aspects to this: customers, the qualifier always and the idea of being right.

For this statement to make sense, the term ""customers""<a0>should be demarcated, or in marketing jargon, segmented. Market segmentation is, however, an artificial construct used to simplify soup."" groups of people. <a title=""How well do you know your customers?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/rvest-and-tidytext/"">Understanding</a> customers does, however, go beyond quantified constructs and focuses on customers as individuals. Furthermore, demographic variables are poor predictors of behaviour as they rely on descriptive, rather than causal factors.[note]Russell J. Haley (1968) Benefit segmentation: a decision-oriented research tool. <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, pp. 30<96>35.[/note]

Customers are individuals that can only be understood within a specific context. This context implies that the statement should be ""<em>the customer</em> is always right"", narrowing it down to individuals, rather than all or some customers.

The second part of the statement, ""always right"", infers a universality. Whatever the customer says, the truth is on their side. However, truth is a tricky concept, specially when combined with a universal statement. Absolute universal truth is mostly proclaimed by religions and not in marketing. The ""always right"" component should be understood as an ethical marker. The term always implies that an organisation should do whatever a customer wants because they are presumed to be always right. However, an organisation serves customers, but can never become the slave of customers as it will undermine economic sustainability. This can be corrected by narrowing the statement down to: ""The customer is sometimes right"". But this is not enlightening and practically tautological.

The way out of this conundrum is to find out what a customer can be right or wrong about. The easy way out is to say that the customer is always right about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-widgets/"">their experience</a>, but that is too much of a simplification as two planes of reality are at work in customer service:

<ul>
    <li>Fact: ""<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1418,00.html"" rel=""noopener"">Waiter, there is</a> a fly in my soup.""</li>
    <li>Feeling: ""I am angry because there is a fly in my soup.""</li>
</ul>

Customers can indeed be wrong about facts because they are by their very nature <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism"">verifiable</a>. A waiter can confirm whether there is a fly in the soup or whether it is an oddly shaped cro<fb>ton. Perception is not reality, and where possible, every claim customers should be verified.

<h2>The customer is always right about their state of mind</h2>

The second type of statement is much harder to verify because it is, in the words of Bernard Williams, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorrigibility"">incorrigible</a>.[note]Bernard Williams, <em>Descartes: The project of pure enquiry</em>, (London: Penguin Books, 1978).[/note] A proposition <em>p</em> is incorrigible when it satisfies this description: ""if I believe that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">p</span>, then <span style=""font-style: italic;"">p</span>"". These statements can neither be verified nor denied, and they assume that the customer is<a0>sincere, and they thus have to be true. Customers<a0>are logically always right about when it comes to incorrigible propositions about how they feel about the level of service. The incorrigibility is problematic because of the implied sincerity. Some customers might exaggerate their feelings to obtain preferential treatment. Some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subconscious_mind"">psychologists</a> would argue, however, that nobody can indeed be sincere about their internal state of mind because of subconscious drives. Although customers might not always know or able to express their state of mind, incorrigible statements are absolute truths to those who utter them.

The original statement can be corrected by saying that ""the customer is always right about their state of mind"". The customer is always right about how they feel about the level of service, and the marketer has to accept these statements as absolute truths.

1385,service-widgets,On the importance of service widgets and experiences,"Most people have heard of widgets, hypothetical thingamajigs manufactured and sold to hypothetical customers of hypothetical businesses. They are often used in exam questions in business courses such as accounting, economics and even more often in marketing classes. However, the study of marketing has evolved from discussion of selling mere widgets.

It could be argued that marketing is not only about selling manufactured things, like widgets, but rather providing a service to customers. In their 2004 paper, Stephen Vargo and Robert Lusch describe this concept nicely when they say:[note]Vargo, S.L. and Lusch, R.F. (2004) The Four Service Marketing Myths: Remnants of a Goods-Based, Manufacturing Model. <em>Journal of Service Research</em>(6)4: 324<96>335. <a href=""http://jsr.sagepub.com/content/6/4/324"">doi: 10.1177/1094670503262946</a>.[/note]

<blockquote>""...times have changed. The focus is shifting away from tangibles and towards intangibles, such as skills, information, and knowledge, and towards interactivity and connectivity and ongoing relationships.""</blockquote>

So what does this migration away from manufactured objects and towards services mean for the business manager?

<h2>Managing the Myths</h2>

If you're looking to understand why everything you offer is a service, it's important to consider four aspects of what you're marketing. Again, borrowing somewhat from Stephen and Robert:[note]Vargo, S.L. and Lusch, R.F.(2004) Evolving to a new dominant logic for marketing. <em>Journal of Marketing</em> 68: 1<96>17. doi: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036"">10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036</a>.[/note]

<ol>
    <li>Even tangible objects that you sell have an element of service to them. A more obvious example is a smart phone (a physical object) with a subscription to phone and internet services. It is important to examine everything you have on offer and try to understand the <em>service</em> it provides and how it can better meet your customer needs.</li>
    <li>Customer's perceptions play a large part in how they evaluate what you have on offer. This is because <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">service levels</a> can vary a great deal more than the physical dimensions of quality-controlled, manufactured widgets. As a business manager, you need to be mindful of your customers' perception of your service and make the most out of the opportunity to customise your service to match individual customers' needs.</li>
    <li>You don't necessarily need to be there for the customer to provide a service. There are countless opportunities to add and enhance the service component of what you're offering customers. One of the best examples of this is making information about the support that you provide to customers pre- and post-purchase available on online.</li>
    <li>Services, like objects, can fail, they can become less fashionable, they can be replicated. It is essential that you continuously improve and innovate your services. It is vital that you ensure you understand the needs of your customers and look at new and more effective ways to meet their needs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Service Widgets</h2>

No one just makes widgets anymore; if there is a physical object to be offered at all, it is entwined with a service of one kind or another. A lucid manager understands how to make the best advantage of the service aspect of what they offer to customers and understands that a widget is merely a tangible and small part of the service being offered.

1348,golden-rule-of-recruitment,The Golden Rule of Recruitment: You get the employees you deserve,"Recruitment of new people or can be a stressful experience. Many organisations maintain extensive procedures to try to find the right person for the right job or even hire specialised <a title=""The Shaman and the Consultant"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consultant-shaman/"">consultants</a> to do the job for them.

They ask strange questions that no reasonable person would ever dare to entertain: ""What are your three trademarks?"", ""What are your biggest mistakes?"" or ""What is the meaning of life"" and ""What is the airspeed velocity of a laden swallow?"". Some even resort to pseudo-scientific <a title=""Personality Test"" href=""http://www.lucidmanager.org/free-personality-test"">personality testing</a> to throw some insights into these strangers across the table.

The problem recruiters have is that it is a lot easier not to hire someone than to fire them later, which leads to complicated processes to reduce this risk. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">Job interviews are thus a bizarre environment</a> that often bears no resemblance to a real professional situation. The fear of taking a risk with a person and a lack of self-confidence in their people skills motivates recruiters to resort to pseudo-scientific tools and hiding behind bizarre interviewing techniques.

<h2>The Golden Rule of Recruitment</h2>

Particularly in a customer service related position a person's ability to <a title=""Smile or else ?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-with-a-smile-mirror-neurons/"">smile</a> and <a title=""How well do you know your customers?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/rvest-and-tidytext/"">understand customers</a> is more important than the results of a personality test or the answer to weird questioning. Asking irrelevant questions only motivates the applicant to <a title=""The Lies We Tell"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deception-in-recruitment/"">bend the truth</a>. Recruitment methods should as much as possible be normal human interaction as ultimately every company gets the <a title=""Getting the employees you deserve - thoughts on recruitment"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/recruitment/"">employees they deserve</a>.

No matter how ritualised the interview process, the Golden Rule of Recruitment remains: You get the employees you deserve."
1414,myth-of-multitasking,The Myth of Multitasking: Focus on one thing to be productive,"A favourite <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/buzzword-bingo/"">buzzword</a> heard around water coolers in offices spanning the globe is <em>multitasking</em>. Employers see the presumed ability to do more than one thing at the same time as the hallmark of a great employee.

People imagine themselves as multi-armed Hindu goddesses or gods of efficiency, aiming to <a title=""Make Time Poverty History!"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/time-poverty/"">manage their time better</a> by doing many things at the same time.

Unfortunately, multitasking is self- deception. Multitasking is, in the words of psychiatrist Edward Hallowell a <em>mythical activity</em> in that people believe they can do two or more tasks simultaneously just as effectively as one.[note]Edward M. Hallowell. <em>Crazy Busy: Overstretched, Overbooked, and About to Snap! Strategies for Handling Your Fast-Paced Life</em>. 2007. Ballantine Books.[/note]

Unfortunately, the feeble human mind is not able to focus attention on more than one thing simultaneously. The myth of multitasking is no better illustrated than by a magician's ability to deceive people, wonderfully demonstrated by Tommy Wonder in the video below. Magicians use techniques based on our limitations in attending to more than one thing simultaneously to create the illusion of magic.[note]Martinez-Conde, Susana and Macknik, Stephen L. (2010)<em> Sleight of mind</em>. New York: Henry Bolt.[/note]

<h2>The Myth of Multitasking</h2>

Neuroscientific research supports this practical knowledge. A neural network in the frontal lobe acts as a bottleneck of information processing that severely limits our ability to multitask. Not only do tasks take longer, but the quality is also reduced.[note]Paul Dux et al. (2006). Isolation of a central bottleneck of information processing with time-resolved fMRI. <em>Neuron</em>, 52: 1109<96>1120. doi:<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.009"">10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.009.</a>)) What managers can learn from magicians and cognitive scientists is that we should focus on only one task at a time.[/note]

921,magician-manager,The Magician Manager: Using Deception in Business,"Every manager would love to have a wand and make things happen magically. Although this vision is only a dream, managers do have a lot in common with magicians. Both the manager and the magician aim to create the world different from the one we know. Both the manager and the magician construct a new reality; the magician uses the stage, and the manager uses the workplace to frame their performance. Another similarity is that many magicians carved out a market in the corporate sector by providing entertainment at Christmas parties and similar occasions. But the similarities don't stop here.

As an amateur magician, I collect academic <a title=""The Science of Conjuring"" href=""https://magicperspectives.net/"">journal articles about conjuring</a> and found two interesting papers exploring the similarities between management and magic.

<h2>The Magician Manager</h2>

David Pollitt described how the management team of a large retailer was invited for a magic show as part of their professional development. Magicians follow rigid <a title=""Not another bloody process!"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">procedures</a> to create the illusion of magic, and the management team were encouraged to do the same to achieve results. Magician Richard Pinner performed a Russian Roulette inspired trick to illustrate that in customer contact there is only one chance to get it right.[note]Pollitt, David (2006). 'Communication campaign conjures up success for Homebase: Magician theme makes for a memorable launch of guides', <em>Human Resource Management International Digest</em> 14(5): 38-39. doi: <a title=""DOI resolver for 10.1108/09670730610678271."" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09670730610678271"">10.1108/09670730610678271</a>.[/note]

Professor's of management Joe Dobson and Terence Krell published a paper on how to use magic tricks to teach organisational behaviour.[note]Krell, Terence C. and Dobson, Joseph J. (1999) The use of magic in teaching organisational behaviour. <em>Journal of Management Education</em>-23: 44-52. doi: <a title=""DOI resolver for 10.1177/105256299902300105"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/105256299902300105"">10.1177/105256299902300105</a>.[/note]

They use magic tricks in the classroom to show that withholding information, like a magician withholds the methods from spectators, can create a power difference. So-called forcing techniques commonly used by magicians are an illustration of the fact that our free will is more often than not bound and limited by the context in which we operate.

Although a magic wand is not a reliable management tool, these examples from the academic literature show that professionals can learn from magic as it provides valuable lessons in psychology.[note]K. Fatehi-Sedeh (1980) A card game as a teaching aid. <em>Journal of Management Education</em> 5(3): 57-60. doi: <a title=""DOI resolver for 10.1177/105256298000500316"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/105256298000500316"">10.1177/105256298000500316</a>.[/note]

Most importantly the magician's ability to distort reality is a reminder that our perception is fragile and that we should always find out the facts, rather than rely on perception. The biggest difference between a manager and a magician is that a magician manages perception to create the illusion of a new reality. Managers focusing on perception, in reality, will find that they are creating an illusion.

1519,management-alchemy,Management Alchemy: What is the Philosopher's Stone of Management?,"Managers and alchemists have a lot in common. Alchemists look for the philosopher's stone to find wisdom while managers seek their inspiration in theories.

In management, <a0>there is a vast disconnect between the popularity of theories and their empirical evidence. Popular theories usually suffer from a lack of empirical validation, while empirically supported theories published in peer-reviewed management journals remain obscure and unknown.

In a recent paper, Mata Alvesson and J<f6>rgen Sandberg lament the field of management studies is stronger in producing rigour than in creating exciting and influential theories.[note]Alvesson, M. and Sandberg, J., 2011.

In the time of Newton, or even much later, a great deal of modern physics, and much that is fundamental in it, was not known, and for this reason perhaps a good deal of bunk was then taught in the field.</blockquote>

Management is historically speaking a very young field of endeavour. Formal studies of how people behave in a professional environment only started when <a title=""The Management Fundamentalism of Frederick Taylor"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/frederick-taylor-management-fundamentalism/"">Frederick Taylor</a> analysed labourers logging pig-iron.

However, in the early days of the physical sciences, even prominent figures such as Isaac Newton spent a considerable amount of time on alchemy and other <a title=""Newton's occult studies"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton's_occult_studies"">occult studies</a> in an attempt to find the Philosopher's Stone.

Whether this means that, several centuries from now, management theory is as successful as physics in controlling reality, remains to be seen. Management, strategy and marketing are inherently social sciences, and people are not billiard balls whose trajectories can be predicted and controlled.

The Philosopher's Stone of management is the art of <em>understanding</em> people. The key to <a title=""The Cult of Personality"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/self-knowledge-for-managers/"">understanding people</a> lies not in the rigorous statistical analysis of questionnaires, but in the life experience of the manager."

Most people live comfortable lives where there only fear is the fear of missing out (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out"" rel=""noopener"">FOMO</a>). Marketers can use this psychological mechanism by feigning scarcity and thus manufacture a fear of missing out, also known as scarcity <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/perspectives-on-marketing/"">marketing</a>. According to Robert Cialdini, scarcity is one of the <em>Six Weapons of Influence</em>, a powerful way to influence consumer attitudes.[note]Cialdini, R.

The release of a new iPhone model or other Apple gadget always seems to be accompanied by long queues of people. Even though customers can pre-order their desired devices, stocks always seem to run low quickly, and there are always lines of people in front of the iconic Apple stores come release date. Just like fast food companies have limited time offers on themed burgers, Apple uses scarcity marketing to stimulate demand.

In the epic battle between Samsung and Apple queueing of customers is used to create the perception of increased value. Samsung has recently taken a line out of Apple's book and established a store close to the flagship Apple store in Sydney, selling $2 phones. Eager punters for this great deal were quickly queueing in front of the Samsung store.[note]Ben Grubb, <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/samsung-ambushes-apples-iphone-4s-launch-in-sydney-20111012-1lk0d.html"">Samsung ambushes Apple's iPhone 4S launch in Sydney</a>, <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>, 12 October 2011.[/note]

The use of scarcity to generate demand has recently been validated by Jeffrey Parker and Donald Lehmann at Columbia University.[note]Parker, J. R., &amp; Lehmann, D. R. (2011). When Shelf-Based Scarcity Impacts Consumer Preferences. <em>Journal of Retailing</em>, <em>87</em>(2), 142-155.[/note] Parker and Lehmann found that retailers can shift demand to a more profitable brand by keeping it less fully stocked.

Scarcity has a mostly positive effect on consumer preferences when they believe that market forces create it. Scarcity is not a positive influence when produced by accidental causes, such as failed delivery. The power balance is, however, always in favour of the marketer as they control the flow of information."
1616,subservient-manager,The Subservient Manager and the Illusion of Hierarchy,"One evening at the dining table (Based on a true story. The names have been changed to protect the innocent):
<blockquote>Hannah: ""What is your job mum?""

Olyvia: ""I manage a team of dentists.""

Hannah: ""So you drill holes in people's teeth?""

Olyvia: ""No, I am a manager""

Hannah: ""What is that?""

Olyvia: ""I make sure my coworkers have everything they need to do their best possible work.""</blockquote>
Management is the craft of achieving objectives vicariously, achievement through other people. The manager-employee relationship is <em>de facto</em> hierarchical. The idea of the manager to control workers was popularised by the Lucid Manager's mortal enemy, <a title=""The Management Fundamentalism of Frederick Taylor"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/frederick-taylor-management-fundamentalism/"">Freddy Taylor</a>. Simply put, the manager controls resources and staff follow instructions. This obvious fact is, however, a great misconception of the true nature of the manager-employee relationship.

When President Nixon met Premier Zhou Enlai in 1972, he asked his thoughts about the French revolution of 1789. Zhou Enlai reportedly considered the question for quite some time before finally answering:
<blockquote>""It's too soon to tell.""</blockquote>
Zhou Enlai was right. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ideals of the enlightenment</a> of people as independent thinkers have after over two hundred years still not been fully realised. The struggle between the ideals of the <em>Ancien R<e9>gime</em> and the Enlightenment can also be seen in management theory. The Taylor inspired scientific view of management versus a more human-centred view is a recurring theme in management literature. At the Lucid Manager, we believe in the ideals of the enlightenment and proclaim a humanistic view on management.
<h2>The Subservient Manager</h2>
Managers are subservient to their employees. It is the subservient manager's task to select the right people, make sure they are provided with sufficient resources, have the proper knowledge and provide a safe working environment. The manager is also responsible for maintaining networks with external stakeholders. Every activity of the manager is aimed at enabling employees to get the work done effectively and efficiently. The manager makes sure that staff can provide value to customers. To refer to Chinese wisdom, Lao-Tzu wrote 2500 year ago:
<blockquote>The highest type of ruler is one of whose existence the people are barely aware.</blockquote>"
1671,inbox-zero,Inbox Triage: Six Simple Rules to Achieve Inbox Zero,"This year it was forty years ago that the first e-mail was sent, starting a double-edged revolution in communication. Most of us are bombarded by messages each day, their inboxes overflowing into an uncontrollable torrent of information, action requests and trivial matters. An overflowing full in-box seriously undermines your effectiveness. A full inbox is stressful as you always are faced with a pile of stuff.

Productivity gurus such as <a href=""https://gettingthingsdone.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">David Allen</a> have developed methods to help us <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/clearing-your-head/"">deal with busy lives</a>.[note]David Allen (2003). <em>Getting things done: The art of stress-free productivity</em>. New York: Penguin.[/note] Others, such as Merlin Mann, stated the Inbox Zero website.

The principle is simple. Just imagine you would never empty your physical mailbox have to search through piles of paper every time you need something. What would be the likelihood that bills get paid on time?

One way to fight your war against <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/time-poverty/"">time poverty</a> is to keep your inbox empty, or at least be able to contain all unactioned e-ails on one screen. The best method to manage your in-box in inspired by battlefield medicine and the principles of <em>triage</em>. Triage is the process of determining the priority of treatment for the wounded based on the severity of their condition.

To be able to manage your inbox and achieve the goal of a inbox zero you should apply ruthless triage on every e-mail that comes across your accounts.

<ul>
    <li>Archive: Anything that contains information for future reference - save the message somewhere outside your in-box.</li>
    <li>Delegate: If you have the luxury of being able to delegate, do so.</li>
    <li>Respond:</li>
    <li>Defer: If it does not have to be done immediately, place the e-mail in your action list or calendar. Don't use your inbox as an action list.</li>
    <li>Do: If it takes less than a few minutes, just get it done.</li>
    <li>Delete Anything that does not require further action should be removed from your inbox.</li>
</ul>

Six simple principles to minimise the amount of stuff in your e-mail accounts. To achieve inbox zero you need to be ruthless like a battlefield surgeon. Our resources and time are limited and applying these simple principles a few times a day will help you keep your inbox clean."

<h2>Deception in Management</h2>

Deception in management forms an integral part of being human. All the Deception in Management is as common as deception in the world outside the office. Our self is not an innate property of the person; it is carefully constructed. Sociologist Erving Goffman uses a theatrical metaphor, inspired by Shakespeare's lines opening this post. We use scripts, buy props and create backdrops for the roles we lay in society.

Professional life is, however, a particular case as the selves we create in the workplace are mostly very different from that which we are in personal experience. Sociologicst <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/managers-new-clothes/"">Erving Goffman</a> once wrote that deception is common among executives:[note]Erving Goffman (1959), <em>The presentation of self in everyday life</em>, Anchor Books.[/note]

<blockquote><85> blinding themselves and others to the fact that they hold their jobs partly because they look like executives, not because they can work like executives.</blockquote>

The prevalence of deception in our daily lives and at work implies that managers can learn from magicians about how to best <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/misdirection-in-presentations/"">present themselves</a>. Work is, after all, merely a play."
85,managing-ambiguity,"Managing ambiguity, do you resole uncertainty or seek opportunity?","A little while ago I was asked whether I was any good at managing ambiguity. My impulsive answer was that I prefer to resolve any<a0>ambiguity by analysing the situation. I responded to this question from the perspective of an engineer. My profession is based on using reason and logic to resolve any ambiguity inherent in reality. I did not realise at the time that this was the 'wrong' answer as I was expected to embrace uncertainty and seek opportunity, or something fuzzy like that.

Philosophically considered the world itself is ambiguous, e.g. light is simultaneously a wave and a particle, ethical judgements are based on cultural preferences, and the notion of absolute truth is philosophically untenable. However, our brains are wired to resolve any<a0>ambiguity.

As soon as we observe light, it will collapse into either a wave or a particle, and within a given culture, ethical rules are absolute truths. Within a particular frame of reference, there can be only one truth. The most efficient tool to resolve uncertainty is logic. But reason itself has its limitations, and sometimes ambiguity remains no matter how much we analyse the situation. It is in these situations that intuition comes into play.

<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-tools/"">Management is a frame of reference</a> in which ambiguity in most cases needs to be resolved. Customers don't appreciate organisations that are ambiguous and require predictable quality. Uncertainty in processes also means business is not working efficiently as employees need to spend time assessing each situation to make a decision.

<h2>Managing Ambiguity</h2>

Management theorist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilkinson_(ambiguity_expert)"">David Wilkinson</a> argues that leaders need to embrace ambiguity to initiate change. This statement is certainly true, but only to the extent, that recognition of ambiguity is necessary to be able to generate possible outcomes and the manager's ability to recognise the best solution. A preference for resolution of ambiguity does not preclude tolerance for vague situations.

Successfully managing a business is based on being able to make clear decisions. Without clear decisions, a company will not achieve its objectives, but without a recognition of managing ambiguity, a business can not evolve. The best managers are te ones that are comfortable holding two opposing views because they know the world is complex and embrace managing ambiguity."

1891,clearing-your-head,Clearing Your head <97> The Key to Getting Things Done,"Do you feel overwhelmed with a head full of thoughts without time to think about useful things? It is time to clear your head.

Preparation:
<ol>
 	<li>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><em>Have pencil and paper ready.</em></div></li>
 	<li><em>Make sure you're in a quiet place without danger to be disturbed before reading on.</em></li>
</ol>
This is a simple yet powerful way to get all those plans and ideas that are buzzing around in your brain all day long under control. These thoughts are constantly distracting you, preventing you from making short- and long-term plans.

The truth is: they can't help it, it's you that haven't decided anything about them that will make them keep nagging you. What you need is a reliable external system to get them out of your head.

One of these completely reliable systems is David Allen's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Getting Things Done</span></a> (GTD) system. But it takes at least a month to read the book and start making this method our own. We don't have that long right now.

There a huge issue with all those loose ends circling both in your head and heading your direction from the outside world. You will be reminded of the stupidest things at the least expected moment. Even worse: don't do anything about them, and they will finally just disappear. Too bad, because while most ideas have no future value, some of them are real gems. One of them might even change the world. So make sure you do something with those gems! How? Read on!
<h2>Clearing Your head: Start Writing</h2>
Grab that pen and paper that have so patiently been waiting next to you. During the next ten minutes, you will start to write down literally everything that's in your head. Try not to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/myth-of-multitasking/"">multitask</a> but fully focus your attention non the list. This exercise will range from small actions that need immediate attention up to big future projects whose impact you cannot yet even fathom. It doesn't matter what it is, once it's written down it will be out of your head. Things you might encounter:
<ol>
 	<li>Cleaning up the backyard</li>
 	<li>Find a good school for my kid</li>
 	<li>Improve my job skills</li>
 	<li>Learn how to use <a href=""http://prezi.com/""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Prezi</span></a> instead of Powerpoint for presentations</li>
 	<li>Write an ebook about<a0><85> (fill in your speciality)</li>
 	<li>Update your daily administration</li>
 	<li>Empty your <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/inbox-zero/"">e-mail inbox</a></li>
 	<li>Prepare presentation for quarterly meeting next week</li>
 	<li>Get XYZ project back on track with Isaac and Charlie</li>
 	<li>And so on, and so on.</li>
</ol>
Don't spend any time thinking about those weird things you're jotting down. What you're going to do with them later is irrelevant now. By the way, did you notice that most things on the list above, apart from items 6 and 7, are bigger things than just one action? In GTD-speak they're called projects, all <93>desired outcomes that take more than one action to complete<94> or goals. Goals are good, but can not be acted on immediately. They need to be made more specific and normally follow the route from defining projects first and actions later.

Now start writing. Take your time and keep writing, until your head is empty. If ten minutes of frantic writing is not enough, hold on. Later you'll thank yourself! OK, there we go, I'm waiting for you <85>

Ready? When everything went according to plan, you now have an impressive list in front of you. Full of actionable items, projects and the more fuzzy goals. With less than 30 points you either have an extremely laid back life or cheated. In the latter case: maybe write a little more? Until the number approaches 50 or even 100 you're probably not done yet. This only works if your head is clear of every loose end you will know when you're done.

What you have achieved now is that everything is in a trusted system outside your head. Now it comes down to the most important thing: <em>doing</em> something with this information. First look at things that can be done in one step: your actions. These go on an action list, to be done the moment you are ready for them. The rest of your items are either projects or goals. Put them on two separate lists, and keep them current. In the future, these lists make it easier for you to focus on what's requiring your attention now (projects) and to check whether your actions are in line with where you're heading in life and work.
<h2>Getting Things Done<97>Bonus Tip</h2>
Overwhelmed by a huge project list? Do not shoot the messenger! ;-) this is all your stuff. Who says you are required to complete the entire list? Take a critical look at the projects that don't give energy and that you can eliminate without risk of getting in trouble. Be honest, there's more to be deleted than you think. You are your judge.

A waste of time, all this list making? On the contrary! You have found a way to get those loose ends out of your head. This will give a tremendous amount of energy and focus. From now on you're doing only things that are important to YOU. It's hard to come up with a better time saver than that, I'd say.

Good luck clearing your head. Did it work? Share your experiences below."
5853,logical-fallacies-in-advertising,Logical Fallacies in Advertising - Analysing Patterns of Rhetoric,"Toulmin analysis is an efficient and powerful tool to assess the validity of arguments. As a PhD student in marketing and a philosopher, I have an ambivalent relationship with the promotional aspect of business.

As a philosopher, I am used to using methods such as the Toulmin Analysis to examine arguments, but in advertising, logic is usually not important. There are many logical fallacies in advertising, not because the designers of the communication lack skills in logical reasoning but because they try to convince the viewer outside of logic.

One of the controversial aspects of marketing and more specifically advertising is the fact that they are aimed at the non-rational dimension of our minds. Even though we are several centuries into the <a title=""The Age of Reason - Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason"">Age of Reason</a>, most of our behaviour is not rational and marketers know this very well. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-advertising/"">Advertising</a> aims to show an idealised world that communicates the value consumers can create with a product.

<h2>Toulmin Analysis</h2>

To see what happens when you rationally analyse a television ad, such as this <em>Garnier Mineral Deodorant</em> clip we can use Toulmin Analysis, designed by influential philosopher Stephen Toulmin.[note]Stephen Toulmin, <em>The Uses of Argument (Cambridge University Press, 1958).</em>[/note] In this model, every rational argument needs to possess a range of attributes. Using this model for the <em>Garnier Mineral Deodorant</em> clip we get:

<ul>
    <li><em>Claim</em>: Garnier Mineral Deodorant reduces perspiration for 48 hours.</li>
    <li><em>Qualifier</em>: None.</li>
    <li><em>Rebuttal</em>: None.</li>
    <li><em>Data</em>: <93>Preferred by 8/10 Australian women<94>.</li>
    <li><em>Warrant</em>: Mineralite reduces perspiration (implicit).</li>
    <li><em>Backing</em>: Not provided.</li>
</ul>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaCZjx9ywHQ

This quick Toulmin analysis shows that there are some key aspects missing to this clip to make it a rationally convincing argument. Advertisements will rarely mention a qualifier, other than the occasional: ""individual results may vary"". Rebuttals are of course never to be seen in advertising, except when compelled by law: ""Smoking kills"". Although the ad mentions that this product is preferred by 80% of Australian women, no evidence is provided to verify this claim.

<h2>Logical Fallacies in Advertising</h2>

The warrant and backing are the most important aspects of the argument. They are the link between the data and the claim if they are not valid, the argument collapses. In most advertising, the warrant is stated implicitly. In this case, the warrant is that <em>Mineralite</em> reduces perspiration. The ad does unfortunately not provide any backing for this claim and thus the argument to use <em>Garnier</em> disappears in a puff of logical smoke. Mineralite is a brand name for <a title=""Wikipedia - Perlite"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlite"">perlite</a>, a volcanic glass with hydrating properties.

The aspects of this advertisement that truly convince consumers to purchase this product is not its logical structure<97>which can be considered a fallacy<97>but the imagery.

It is interesting to note that the <a title=""German version of the Garnier ad"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AQN4agcAqE"">German version</a> of this ad makes the warrant explicit. It also uses the word 'sweat' while the Australian version is less explicit in its wording. The images show an ideal that the targeted consumers can identify with. Advertisers and politicians know that we are more easily persuaded by non-rational arguments and the Toulmin Analysis is a very effective way to point this out."
1733,3mt-2012,Customer Service and Tap Water: 3MT Presentation,"Every year two million people die because of dirty water. Access to clean tap water is essential. It enhances our lifestyle and increases our lifespan by several decades.

The picture below shows how water is provided to your house and the central role it plays in our lives. My research is about how businesses that supply tap water provides service to their customers.

Most tap water companies are owned<a0>by governments. But due to economic pressures water suppliers around the world are being privatised. Water services in France, England, several African countries and even communist Cuba are in private control.

Many economists argue that private water companies provide<a0>better customer service than government-owned<a0>organisations. But is this the case? Limited empirical research has been done to test this assumption. The main question I am seeking to answer is:

<blockquote>Are <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-privatisation/"">privately owned</a> companies actually better service providers?</blockquote>

My research consists of two parts. First, I am reviewing what customer service in tap water means and second I am looking at how water companies are managed<a0>and provide service to customers.

The worst possible water service exists in some developing countries where people spend hours every day fetching their daily water supply. The best possible service exists in developed countries like Australia; you open a tap and water appear, without it taking any time. But, when the system fails, and no water comes out of the tap, we need to spend extra time to do what we need to do. This concept leads to the idea that the perfect water company is 'invisible' to the consumer.

An <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">invisible water company</a> delivers water whenever you want it; you never need to ring them; bills are easy to understand and so on. Using this concept, I can measure the level of service provided to customers.

Generally speaking, private companies provide<a0>excellent service because they need to please customers to make a profit. Public organisations provide excellent service because they want to please politicians. But is voter satisfaction the same as customer satisfaction? I am developing a model to measure how customer-focused different water companies are, building on existing research in marketing and some new concepts that I am developing.

I will combine this information with the model to measure customer service to answer my research question. My hypothesis is that there is no difference in customer service between private and public water services, but only empirical research will be able to confirm or deny this.

From an academic point of view, my research will add to the work on organisational culture and how it relates to customer service. Practically I hope my research will help water companies, like the one I work for, to become more customer focused and assist governments in considering privatisation of water services to make more informed decisions."
135,vicwater-conference-2012,VicWater Conference 2012 Presentation | The Invisible Water Utility,"This article is an abstract and presentation about my viewed on customer service in tap water, held at the <a title=""2012 VicWater Conference"" href=""http://www.vicwater.org.au/index.php?sectionid=618"">2012 VicWater conference</a> in Melbourne.

<h2>The Invisible Water Utility</h2>

The provision of<a0>water and sanitation services is an essential part of life that is being taken for granted in the developed world and citizens expect a high level of service at a reasonable cost.

The determination of<a0>reasonable cost and level of service are complicated<a0>issues, and in Victoria, the discourse on this subject is dominated by the<a0><a title=""Essential Services Commission"" href=""http://www.esc.vic.gov.au"">Essential Services Commission</a> (ESC). In this paper, an alternative model for the measurement of<a0>service quality is proposed based on contemporary thinking in the field of services marketing.

The services for water and sanitation can be divided into core and supplementary services; the core services being the supply of water and the removal of wastewater. Facilitating services are billing, payment facilities, fault correction, information provision and so on. Enhancing services are activities that do not impact the core service, such as technical assistance to developers.

In the marketing of services, the term <em>Moment of Truth</em><a0>is used<a0>to describe the instant of<a0>interaction between the customer and the service provider. In water and sanitation services, customers experience many thousands of moments of truth each year. Every time a tap is opened<a0>or a toilet is flushed a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">Moment of Truth</a>. If water appears, the expectations are confirmed<a0>leading to customer satisfaction. If no water emerges from the tap or is delivered<a0>at the wrong quality, the expectation is disconfirmed, leading to customer dissatisfaction.

In economic models to determine<a0>the price of water, the cost to the consumer is restricted<a0>to monetary cost. The cost to a consumer should, however, be extended to include externalities. The time required for obtaining<a0>water services<97>including facilitating services. Given the high level of development, the time to collect water in Australia is negligible. This negligible time cost is, however, not the case for facilitating services, which includes the recovery from service failures.

The <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">Invisible Water Utility</a> is a concept used to describe the highest possible level of service quality. In a perfect world, customers of a water corporation never contact the business. Bills are paid automatically, billing is accurate<a0>and easy to understand, and every time a tap is turned, or a toilet is flushed, expectations are met, and there is no need to contact the corporation, boil water or other time-consuming activities.

This conceptual idea can develop into a new model to measure service quality. The criteria currently used by the Essential Service Commission<a0>are indicators of a high level of service but do not measure the actual<a0>impact on customers. For example, the repair of a water burst itself should only be considered a service failure for those customers attempting to use water. Measuring the responsiveness at which phone calls are answers is in itself not a complete indicator of service quality. Every question forms a customer regarding<a0>billing is the time they need to invest to enjoy the service and should be<a0>avoided.

The Invisible Water Utility is a concept under development as part of my PhD research into the relationship between organisational culture and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-perception/"">service quality</a> in the water and sanitation industry.

31,lazy-marketers,Are Tap Water Managers Lazy Marketers?,"Water is like air<97>a naturally occurring substance without which life is not possible. But unlike air, tap water is a commercial commodity that is only available at a price from water utilities.

In developed countries, tap water is provided through reticulated systems. Pipes in your street deliver water directly to your house, and you pay the price, depending on the amount of water used. Even though tap water pricing is a controversial topic, it is very cheap. With prices of less than one cent per litre, filling a bottle of water costs practically nothing. But, not all water is the same. Purveyors of bottled water charge hundreds of times the price people pay for tap water, even though the core product is the same.

<h2>Lazy Marketers?</h2>

In an episode of Australian comedy show <em>Gruen Transfer</em>, advertising executive Russel Howcroft facetiously explained this price difference by stating that water utilities are lazy marketers. Is Russel correct?

<h2>Marketing Tap Water</h2>

Most managers at water utility companies believe that there is no need for marketing because reticulated water is a natural monopoly. But marketing is more than selling and advertising. In the words of Phillip Kotler, marketing is ""customer satisfaction engineering"".<a0>Marketing is the process of creating value for the customer. [note]Kotler, P., &amp; Levy, S. J. (1969). Broadening the concept of marketing. <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, <em>33</em>, 10<96>15.[/note]

Bottled water companies create brands that are built on images of pristine rivers and healthy happy people. Water utility companies mostly brand themselves with technology, proudly showing their latest treatment facilities, pumps and pipelines. Bottled water companies focus on the emotional aspects of their brand, while water utilities follow a more rational technological approach.

Why are we willing to pay so much more for bottled water? Willingness to pay is, among other things, related to the level of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">involvement</a> we have with the product. [note]Cohen, M. (2000). Consumer involvement is driving up the cost. <em>Consumer Policy Review</em>, 10(4), 122<96>125.[/note]<a0> Potable water is considered<a0>a low involvement product. We don't care about the water, as long as it is available. Potable water derived from the tap cannot be differentiated from other potable water as all H<sub>2</sub>O is the same. Bottled water companies know this, so they increase the level of involvement and differentiate from the competition through effective branding. Bottled water companies create a brand personality by attaching images of naturalness and purity to their product. They never show the bottling plant, the pipes and pumps they use to create their product. Bottled water companies attach <em>emotion</em> to their brand, which increases our level of involvement and our willingness to pay.

I am not arguing that through smart marketing water utilities can charge as much as <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/bottled-water-marketing/"">bottled water companies</a><97>that would make having a bath a costly experience. Tap water is used<a0>for many purposes, including flushing it down the toilet, which limits the amount we are willing to pay. [note]Levy, D. (1982). Diamonds, water, and Z goods: an account of the paradox of value. <em>History of Political Economy</em>, <em>14</em>(3), 312<96>322.[/note]

Russell is, however, correct in saying that water utilities are lazy markers because they are pre-occupied with their internal technological perspective on the product. Why not focus more on the people who use the water? The above example from the New York City water company is an excellent case in point.

83,price-of-water,"The Price of Water: Views from the Bible, Plato and Adam Smith","Much has been written about the prices of water. Economists have written vast amounts of books and papers on the topic of the price of water. These dry studies (pun intended) are often loaded with formulas that aim to describe how much people are willing to pay for water. Deliberations about the price of water are, however, nothing new and in several ancient sources we can find views on this topic:

The Bible (<a title=""Bible Gateway"" href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+55%3A1&amp;version=NIV"">Isaiah 55:1</a>) sees water as a human right. A point of view that many people seem to have in debates about water prices:

<blockquote>Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.</blockquote>

This invitation to the thirsty shows the importance of water in semi-arid cultures. This quote positions water as a human right to be shared by all without having to pay for it. Some have argued that water is a God-given right and should not have a price. The counter-argument is that the water might fall free from the sky, but the pumps and pipes needed to deliver it to customers is not.

Plato (<a title=""The Classics Archive"" href=""http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/euthydemus.1b.txt"">Euthydemus</a> 304B), refers to the Ancient Greek lyric poet from Thebes:

<blockquote>For only what is rare is valuable; and ""water,"" which, as Pindar says, is the ""best of all things,"" is also the cheapest.</blockquote>

Adam Smith, in his book <a href=""http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN1.html#B.I, Ch.4, Of the Origin and Use of Money"">Wealth of Nations</a><a0>(Book I: 4.13) described what has become known as the <a title=""Pardox of Value"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">Diamond<97>Water Paradox</a>.

<blockquote>Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.</blockquote>

A more mundane example comes from the quiz show <em>Family Feud</em>. In an episode of the Australian version, they asked contestants what they though people answered when asked what should be free. Water was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the top answer.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6555 size-full"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2012/10/FamilyFeud.jpg"" alt=""The Price of Water: Family Feud"" width=""632"" height=""419"" />"
4129,demarketing-water,Demarketing Water Supply,"According to an announcement by the International Water Association, four in ten senior executives from water utilities around the world believe that it is highly likely that water demand will outstrip supply shortly due to <93>wasteful consumer behaviour<94>. A report by Oracle (<a title=""Water for All?"" href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/utilities/utilities-water-for-all-ar-1865053.pdf""><em>Water for all?</em></a>) found that water managers perceive high water use by customers as the biggest threat to the sustainability of supply.

Does this statement betray a lack of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-customer-focus/"">customer focus</a> by water managers? The Oracle report has, like most publications on water management, a technological focus and does not seem to consider the marketing aspects of water management.

Marketing is not exclusively focused on increasing sales, in essence, marketing is the process of creating customer satisfaction, which goes beyond sales and promotion. In water management marketing is often a case of <em>demarketing.</em> In the words of Kotler and Levy:[note]Kotler<a0>P, Levy S. (1971) Demarketing, yes, demarketing. <em>Harvard Business Review</em><a0>49(6):74-80.[/note]

<blockquote>Rather than blindly engineering increases in sales, the marketer's task is to shape demand to conform with long-run objectives.</blockquote>

<h2>Demarketing Water</h2>

Excess demand is as much a marketing problem as excess supply. This situation does not only occur in the sale of natural resources like water, but there are also many instances where commercial companies use demarketing<a0>in order not to disappoint too many consumers. Companies like Apple even use <a title=""Using Queueing as a Marketing Tool"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/scarcity-marketing/"">shortages</a> to create a positive image of their product. Businesses can, according to Kotler<a0>and Levy, use several strategies for demarketing:

<ul>
    <li>Reduce advertising, sales promotions and selling</li>
    <li>Increase the price and other conditions of sale.</li>
    <li>Increase time needed to use the service and psychological cost.</li>
    <li>Reduce the quality of the service.</li>
    <li>Reduce the number of sale outlets.</li>
</ul>

The first and last options are not applicable to water utilities<97>as <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-privatisation/"">monopolists,</a> there is no need to sell the service and water companies cannot reduce sale outlets. Increasing time-<a0>and the psychological cost has been used<a0>in Australia when under certain water restrictions gardens can only be watered using hand-held hoses. Reducing the quality of the service can be achieved by minimising the pressure of the water, thus reducing usage.

In demarketing water, the same strategies that are used<a0>in positive marketing, i.e. maximising sales, can be used to curtail consumer demand. Demarketing should not only focus on promotion to change attitudes but the total <a title=""Marketing Mix in Wikipedia"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-marketing-mix/"">marketing mix</a><97>Product, Price, Place and Promotion<97>needs to be<a0>taken into consideration.[note]Cullwick, D. (1975). Positioning demarketing strategy.<em> Journal of Marketing, </em><em>39</em>(2), 51-51.[/note]"
2625,functional-silos,The Value of a Functional Silos to Deliver Business Objectives,"Functional silos are among the evilest things that can happen to a manager. Well, that is what you are lead to believe when attending the average management workshop.

One of the first things people mention when asked what is wrong with their work is having a <93>silo mentality<94>. Organisational silos are evil, and everybody who tries to build one runs the risk of becoming a pariah. I think silos are inevitable and valuable<97>I designed some early in my career as shown in the picture above.

A silo mentality is so prevalent that a small vocabulary has built up around this phenomenon: <91>information silo', <91>silo thinking', <91>the silo effect', <91>functional silo' and so on. The language around removing silos is quite vigorous and evocative: silos need to be <91>demolished<92>, <91>blown up<92> or <91>torn down<92>. Surely, any manager using this type of language is serious about his job!

This article proposes a more <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/socratic-management/"">philosophical approach</a> and gently deconstructs, not demolish or blow up, the concept of silo mentality to show that they are not as evil as many managers believe.

<h2>Embrace functional silos mentality to deliver value</h2>

There is no proper definition of what a silo mentality is. A recent paper goes to the extreme and suggests that people who display a silo mentality are mentally ill.[note]Cilliers, F., &amp; Greyvenstein, H. (2012). <a href=""http://www.sajip.co.za/index.php/sajip/article/view/993"" rel=""noopener"">The impact of silo mentality on team identity</a>: An organisational case study.<em> SA Journal of Industrial Psychology, </em><em>38</em>(2), 1<96>9.[/note]

<blockquote>Psychodynamically, silos represent the phallic characteristics of male dominance, submission and persecution. They are characterised by intra- and intergroup anxiety followed by the infantile and regressive defensive structures</blockquote>

On a positive side, functional silos are vertically aligned teams with experts in their respective fields. Silos shape expert knowledge communities that can reach consensus, make decisions and act efficiently and effectively. By embracing and nurturing functional silos, an agency's expertise can flourish.[note]Paulson, J. (2010). <a href=""http://www.dmnews.com/agency/embrace-silos-to-deliver-value/article/179026/"" rel=""noopener"">Embrace silos to deliver value</a>.<em> DM News, </em><em>32</em>(17), 32<96>32.[/note]

Pointing at silos to identify why an organisation is not<a0>optimally functioning is a way to blame somebody else for your problems. Instead of wielding the silo, managers should practice some introspection and think about how they can improve communication with other experts in their organisation. Don't blame somebody else for not wanting to cooperate with you, think of ways you can motivate them instead of using strong language and start demolishing, tearing down and blasting their silos."
189,marketing-myopia,Marketing Myopia in Tap Water Services,"A few weeks ago I ran a workshop for a group of senior managers of a tap water supplier. The workshop consisted of a series of rhetorical questions designed to spawn discussion about the meaning of customer service in tap water. When asking the question: <93>What service do you provide?<94> the answers were mainly based on the physical aspects: physically providing water to customers. The water managers were wrong! A tap water company is, paradoxically, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/asset-performance-customer-experience/"">not about selling tap water</a>.

<h2>Marketing myopia</h2>

Managers of water utilities who believe that they merely sell water suffer from so-called <91>marketing myopia<92>, a term coined in 1960 by <a title=""Theodore Levitt"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Levitt"">Theodore Levitt</a>.[note]Levitt, T. (1960). Marketing Myopia.<a0><em>Harvard Business Review</em>,<a0>38(May/June), 45<96>56.[/note] This<a0>is a situation where an organisation focuses on selling products or services instead of focusing on satisfying customer needs.

There is a lot of confusion about the difference between needs and wants. In<a0>marketing the common sense definition<97>needs are obligatory and wants are discriminatory<97><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-value-proposition/"">does not apply</a>.[note]Maslow, A. H. (1943). A theory of human motivation. <em>Psychological Review</em>, 50(4), 370<96>396.[/note] Needs are a state of felt deprivation which is either physical, social or psychological.

Looking at water as a service, we need some water to physically survive and for hygiene. Al significant amount of the water we use for hygiene is, however, driven by sociological needs because of western values towards cleanliness. People also <em>need</em> water for their gardens because it gives them a sense of accomplishment. People <em>need</em> water for their swimming pool, because it provides them an outlet for social belonging. Nobody buys water just for the pleasure of owning it, water has a purpose.

One of the main rules in consumer behaviour is that we do not buy products for what they do, but for what they mean.[note]Belk, R. W. (1988). Possessions and the extended self. <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em>, 15(2), 139<96>168.[/note] So as marketers we do not judge the consumer's needs or wants. Consumers need water for social and psychological reasons, as much as they need it for physiological reasons.

<h2>Avoiding marketing myopia</h2>

Good marketing is about satisfying the needs of the customers, which means you need to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/sociological-imagination-in-marketing/"">understand<a0>them</a>. In the context of water it is important to understand what your customers do with the water. Looking at websites of water utilities shows a large focus on the technology to deliver the product. There seems to be<a0>a need to tell consumers how much effort is required to give them their daily tap water instead of showing the benefits of using the water.

<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/bottled-water-marketing/"">Bottled water companies</a> have a different<a0>view on this issue. Their communication material never shows the production process, they show the origin of the water or the benefits it provides. This ad from Fiji water emphasises the purity of the water by using the word <91>untouched<92>. Bottled water companies connect their product not with technology, but with nature and beautiful healthy people.

We need a paradigm shift in the<a0>way tap water is marketed by utilities. Not because <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-competition/"">customers might defect to the competition</a>, but to create goodwill. Many water companies try to do this by rationally explaining how hard it is to create drinking water. Well, I am sorry to say that your customers don't care about water as much as you do.

A much more effective way is to tap into the emotions of your customers and link your product to the benefits it provides them, or the pristine origins of the water. A water utility is not about selling water, it is about promoting health, providing water to have fun, grow your own vegetables or relax in a bubble bath."
2890,dumb-objectives,Are SMART objectives smart? Introducing DUMB objectives,"SMART objectives are a seemingly immutable law in management, formulated initially by George Doran in 1981.[note]Doran, G. T. (1981). There<92>s a S.M.A.R.T. way to write managements' goals and objectives. <em>Management Review</em>, <em>70</em>(11), 35<96>36.[/note]

We are told in management seminars that objectives should be, in the words of Doran, Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic and Time-related.<a0> Many varieties have spawned from the minds of managers across geography and time, each focusing on slightly different aspects of the meme. There is no science behind this, as is the case with most <a title=""Welcome to the Matrix"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-tools/"">popular management memes</a>. The original meme has evolved through successive mutations.

<h2>DUMB Objectives</h2>

<blockquote><93>What you measure is what you get<85><94></blockquote>

The term Specific can also be written as: <91>stretching<92> or <91>simple<92>; measurable has mutated into <91>meaningful<92>, <91>motivational<92> and <91>manageable<92>, Assignable is in most cases turned into <91>achievable<92>, which is the same as being realistic. Realistic in turn has morphed into <91>relevant<92> or <91>resource-based<92> and lastly <91>time-related<92> has stood the test of time and has not changed much in the various mutations of the original definition. Some have even extended the mnemonic and defined SMARTER objectives.

Many managers seem to struggle with defining SMART objectives, evidenced by the multitude of websites and magazine articles devoted to this topic. The meme<97>I dare not call it a theory as there is no real research into the effectiveness of this popular business tool<97>is driven by the idea that we can only manage what we can measure. This approach is<a0>driven by the often cited words of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch: <93>What you measure is what you get<85><94>.

I propose that organisations start using DUMB objectives:

<ul>
    <li>Devious</li>
    <li>Unfair</li>
    <li>Manipulative</li>
    <li>Bizarre</li>
</ul>

Others before me have also defined DUMB Targets: See Evan Carmichael, <a title=""DUMB Goals"" href=""https://www.michaeldpollock.com/dumb-goals-smart-goals/"">DUMB Goals</a>.

Any list of adjectives that can remotely be related to management will do. Just Google <93>adjectives starting with <85><94> and create your acronym. If you find a good one, please add it to the comments box.

<h2>Are SMART Objectives smart?</h2>

<blockquote><93>Too often we measure everything and understand nothing<94></blockquote>

Not everything activity in an organisation is measurable and using SMART targets often obfuscates the fact that business is about human interaction and can not always be placed into a quantitative straight-jacket.

How can you specify a SMART target for having empathy for customers? How do you define a measurable objective for having a <a title=""Service With a Smile"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-with-a-smile-mirror-neurons/"">genuine smile?</a>

There is an inherent <a title=""The Incompleteness Theorem of Service Quality Measurement"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality/"">incompleteness</a> in relying on quantitative measures when managing an organisation that deals with people and people are the very cornerstone of every organisation. It is undeniable that measurement is essential in business. Although quantitative performance<a0>measurement is a <em>necessary condition,</em> it is not a<em> sufficient condition</em> for holistic performance measurement. To understand their business, managers must take the responsibility of venturing beyond the figures and dashboard displays. Perhaps DUMB targets can help to break the mould by deviating from the norm as a pathway to open innovation."
2909,reinventing-the-wheel,Reinventing the wheel? <97> Repetitiveness in business theory,"I am presenting my work at the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/incompleteness-theorem-of-service-quality/"">World Business Conference</a> in Auckland. One of the things that struck me listening to fellow presenters is the repetitive nature of the presentations. Not that they are bad presentations, but it seems that research is repeating itself. When a presenter throws up the next slide with profound truths many people think ""duh, common sense"", others have an '<a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Aha-Erlebnis"">aha-erlebnis</a>'<97>a moment of sudden insight, and the rest of the audience does not notice as they gently fall asleep due to Powerpoint overload.

<h2>Is business theory busy reinventing the wheel?</h2>

Some<a0><a title=""Welcome to the Matrix"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-tools/"">business theories</a> are based on rigorous research while others are intuitive and akin to pop-psychology. What all business theories have in common is that they aim to influence behaviour. Management is about changing or controlling the conduct of employees; marketing seeks to modify the behaviour of customers and strategy is about the behaviour of stakeholders and the competition.

Most business theories<a0>are unintentionally based on the idea that people are rational. But contemporary economics and marketing have found that our rationality is limited. Our brains stop us from following the normative theories in business. Being in business is a constant struggle between the rational part of our minds and its natural tendencies. Plato described humans as a chariot pulled in different directions by two horses: reason and the emotions. Going to business conferences and hearing the same stories over and over again might be a way to give the horse of reason more power.

Maybe it is not about reinventing the wheel, but perhaps<a0>management theory is about keeping the wheel turning. We need to be continuously reminded of the obvious through variations on the theme.

Google in their infinite machine learning wisdom has found the ultimate answer to the management question and has defined <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/eleven-rules-of-management/"">The Eleven Rules of Management</a>. Whether these eleen rules are indeed the final answer is doubtful. The harder question is to ask whether we need to keep this wheel turning and maybe we should give some more credence to the non-rational dimension in management. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/not-rocket-science/"">Management is not rocket science</a>; it is much harder because dealing with people goes beyond the horizon of reason."

Cyndi asked which part of a car is the most essential. The audience mentioned several options, and then it dawned on me that this analogy is much like a famous line of reasoning in Buddhist philosophy about the self, which I will use to show that there is no such thing as an organisation and that no one part of an organisation is essential or more important than another.

<h2>The idea of the firm in Buddhist management</h2>

The Buddhist management view of the firm would be that there is no such entity, illustrated by a debate between King Milinda and the Buddhist monk Nagasena.[note]Edward Conze, <em>Buddhist Scriptures</em><a0>(London: Penguin Books, 1959), pp. 147<96>149.[/note]

Following the analogy<a0>used by the<a0>monk, we can compare a firm with a chariot, or in more modern terms a car. None of the individual parts<a0>of the car (the wheels, the engine, the radio and so on), <em>are</em> the car. Nor can you say that the combination of<a0>the parts is the car. We can not discover a firm at all, only the word that denotes the idea of the business. A business consists of its parts, just like a car does. None of the components of the firm, however, <em>are</em> the firm. No part is less important than the other<97>although followers of the Lean philosophy will disagree on this one.

The Buddhist management argument extends to management in that a firm is not about its constituent parts, but a firm is a cycle of cause and effect, or in Buddhist terms, <a title=""Karma, Dharma &amp; Moksa"" href=""https://prevos.net/humanities/philosophy/karma/"">Karma</a>. A firm is not about its CEO, the share price, employees, customers or fancy headquarters. A company, just like a person, is defined by the actions it takes and their results.

Following the Buddhist view to its conclusion, there is only one pillar of organisational greatness: the actions taken by the organisation and the impact these actions have on the beneficiaries.

5786,marketing-toilet-paper,The Evolution of Marketing Toilet Paper,"Toilet paper is an essential product for a comfortable life. This statement might seem obvious, but the current status of toilet paper is quite recent. Humanity reached dizzying heights of cultural achievement before we were bestowed with the luxury of soft tissue to clean our bottoms. In the late 19th-century, toilet paper was marketed as a luxury product, and it quickly became embedded in the cultural landscape of the Western world through effective marketing.

The amount of choices for a product that is merely used to keep our behinds clean is bewildering. At the supermarket, we grab our favourite brand without any giving it much thought. How do we decide what toilet paper to use?<a0> This article briefly reviews someone of the techniques used in marketing toilet paper and how advertising helps us to select our favourite brand of paper.

My interest in toilet paper is closely related to my work as a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/engineering-marketing-interface/"">water engineer</a>. Water utilities transport and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/yuck-factor/"">process sewage</a>, and toilet paper is one of the substances that our pipes, pumps and plants process to ensure human waste does not endanger public health or the natural environment.

<h2>Consumer Involvement and Toilet Paper Marketing</h2>

The amount of energy we are willing to invest in a decision depends on the level of involvement we have with the product. Consumer involvement is a measure of the importance a consumer places on a product or service.[note]Zaichkowsky, J. L. (1985). Measuring the involvement construct. <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em>, <em>12</em>(3), 341<96>352.[/note]<a0> Commodities such as toilet paper and tap water are <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-involvement/"">low involvement products</a> because they require little thought in their purchase.[note]Ratchford, B. T. (1987). New insights about the FCB grid. <em>Journal of Advertising Research</em>, <em>27</em>(4), 24<96>38.[/note]

Low involvement products are hard to sell because, by definition, consumers don't pay much attention to them. This low involvement is why marketers developed techniques to increase the level of involvement and in effect create a market where one previously did not exist. This practice <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/09/what_do_bears_have_to_do_with_toilet_paper.html"">started in the 1890s</a> when the <em>Scott Paper Company</em> became the first to offer toilet paper on a roll and advertise it with a range of images positioning it as a luxury product.

Toilet paper marketing has evolved over the years. The 1980s advertisement below emphasises the material properties of the toilet paper. The ad shows images of the factory and talks about the production process to convince the consumer that this is the best possible paper on the market. This communication tries to increase the involvement consumers have with toilet paper by emphasising the features of the product.

https://youtu.be/1ypWFKvWsC8

A recent advertisement for the same product uses a different strategy. This ad is not trying to communicate that dogs should use toilet paper. This advertising and similar toilet paper marketing communications appeal to an ideal lifestyle to sell products.

The ad below barely mentions the physical benefits of the Kleenex product, but it shows an enviable home setting. This purpose of this piece of communication is to associate the Kleenex brand with the perfect life depicted in the images. Who would not want to live in a house with shiny polished floorboard and a labrador pet dog?

https://youtu.be/mg6qPVA3_HY

<h2>Marketing Toilet Paper and the Ideal Self</h2>

The products we purchase are an extension of our self; a means to construct an identity.[note]Belk, R. W. (1988). Possessions and the extended self. <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em>, <em>15</em>(2), 139<96>168.[/note] Toilet paper manufacturers have used this psychological construct to capture the market. In supermarket aisles, we are bombarded by a plethora of types of toilet paper to choose from. The bewildering array of choices ranges from one, two or even three-ply, scented, non-scented, hypo-allergenic, recycled, non-bleached, rainforest certified and so on, and so on. There is a type of toilet paper for every segment of the market. Because we are subjected to this wide range of choices, we are forced to make one. The basic principle of marketing is to increase the likelihood that a consumer will choose your product.

The primary reason toilet paper manufacturers spend so much money on developing new types of toilet paper and advertising their product is that they want us to care about toilet paper. Not only by developing a product variant for every imaginable preference, but also by adding emotion to an otherwise dull product. Toilet paper advertising features cute puppy dogs, babies and other images that trigger emotions. When consumers are involved, they are hesitant to choose lower price alternatives and suppliers of toilet paper use this by creating a high level of involvement and charging higher prices than they otherwise could.[note]Cohen, M. (2000). Consumer involvement--driving up the cost. <em>Consumer Policy Review</em>, <em>10</em>(4), 122<96>125.[/note]

In this respect, marketing toilet paper is very similar to marketing <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/bottled-water-marketing/"">bottled water</a>. The only way to convince consumers to purchase bottled water instead of using the 1000 times cheaper tap water is by manufacturing involvement with the product. Just like toilet paper, bottled water marketing creates an emotional connection with the customers with lifestyle imagery.

The high willingness to pay for toilet paper is no better illustrated than by what I observed during a recent visit to a supermarket in Kangaroo Flat in Australia. They sell rolls of specially printed Christmas toilet paper for $4.49 each, almost ten times as much as ordinary toilet paper. Cleaning your bottom with jolly messages and images makes life just that much more worth living. Christmas is a time when people are prepared to spend money on silly items, and a roll of special toilet paper can provide a lot of value because it becomes an instant conversation starter, as evidenced by this article.

2613,value-based-management,The Value of Value-Based Management,"Many organisations espouse to implement value-based management. There are several <a title=""Definitions of Value Based Management"" href=""http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/faq_what_is_value_based_management.html"">definitions</a> of what value-based management is, but most are not very illuminating. The consensus is that value-based management is a tool to achieve organisational consistency, or from a more cynical perspective, values are a device to control behaviour.

Philosophers refer to words such as value an <91>essentially contested concept<92>, which means that there is no agreement on the definition of value, which has espoused a complex branch of philosophy called <a title=""Axiology"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology"">axiology</a>.

In practice, value-based management leads to a list of<a0><a title=""What are abstract nouns?"" href=""http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/nouns/Abstract-Nouns.html"">abstract nouns</a> that the organisation advocates. But, which of the many hundreds of positively interpreted abstract nouns in the English language do you choose?

Which value is critical to your organisation? Do you prefer creativity over punctuality? Or should we have pride in our work or is it dedication we are after? Any word that has positive connotations and ends in -tion, -ism, -ity, -ment, -acy and so on will do. Defining a list of value, which usually is no longer than four, is restrictive and leads to the implicit exclusion of other positive values.

Value-based management is primarily a crude implementation of <a title=""Virtue based ethics"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics"">virtue-based ethics</a>. This approach leads to tensions because most organisations don't work according to virtues but follow a <em>consequentialist</em> approach; valuing those behaviours that lead to positive outcomes. Consequentialism can be problematic because not all activities that lead to the right results can be considered ethical. I have argued in an <a title=""Environmental Ethics for Managers"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/environmental-ethics-for-managers-deontic-constraints/"">earlier paper</a> that deontic constraints are required to maintain the goal-oriented nature of business in an ethical environment.

<h2>Value-based management is of little value</h2>

In value-based management, it is assumed that following an arbitrary list of abstract nouns will lead to good business outcomes. These lists of<a0>abstract nouns are a cheat-sheet for employees on how to behave and a way for management or colleagues to assess the behaviour of others.

The values chosen from the multitude of available abstract nouns are usually decided democratically, without systematic examination of all available options. I prefer to stick to the list defined by<a0><a title=""Aristotelian ethics"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics"">Aristotle</a>, more than 2000 years ago: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; kindness and temperance.

Most businesses are not honest in their chosen values, <a title=""Enron' mission and values"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/analyse-enron-corpus/"">Enron being an excellent case in point</a>. The never list greed any of the other deadly sins as their real core values. And those so-called deadly sins are not always wrong. Peter Nowak argued convincingly that the seven deadly sins propelled humanity more for good than bad.

Value-based management is of little value as it ignores the practical outcomes of behaviours. It is also flawed because it arbitrarily highlights some values of others. Surely to be ethical, we should behave in accordance with positive values and not just those printed on our coffee mugs."

<h2>Tap Water Marketing</h2>

Many professionals in the water industry <a title=""Do water utilities need to have customer focus?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-customer-focus/"">consider tap water marketing unnecessary</a> as most service providers are natural monopolies owned by governments. But marketing entails more than the recruitment and retention of customers. Marketing is about maximising value for customers and the principles defined in the <em>7 Graces</em> can be used to provide a framework for the marketing of monopolistic services.

<h3>1. Connection</h3>

The first of the <em>7 Graces</em> relates to knowing yourself to communicate better. In marketing speak, this is the so-called <91>value proposition<92>. This statement is not an empty catchphrase, but an essential aspect of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-branding/"">customer relationships</a>. A value proposition is the entire set of experiences that an organisation provides to customers. The value proposition is where the service provider and customer connect with each other.

<h3>2. Inspiration</h3>

Advertising aims to convince consumers to become your customers. In a monopolistic environment, there is no need for obtaining customers and advertising can be used to inform and inspire customers. Providing water is a service which people use to meet certain needs, either drinking water for life, a swimming pool for social belonging or a garden to be able to express your creativity. Water companies can <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/value-of-water/"">increase the value of service</a> by providing information about how to use water in the best possible way and inspire people to maximise the value of the water they purchase.

<h3>3. Invitation</h3>

Most customers of water utilities are not interested in tap water as such; they want the water without hassle. The ideal water corporation, i.e. the <a title=""The Invisible Water Corporation"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">Invisible Water Utility</a>, focuses on providing excellent service without being intrusive to its customers. But for those that seek further information, we should provide all the information they need about our services.

<h3>4. Directness</h3>

Governments own most tap water companies. Their existence and actions are enshrined in law. This situation can lead to bureaucratic communication instead of real customer service. Directness implies placing the needs of the customer first instead of being locked into bureaucratic processes. Directness can be achieved by communicating with your customers in plain English and placing meeting their personal needs before using regulations to justify not helping them.

<h3>5. Transparency</h3>

Deception is a part of the human condition and often deliberately used in marketing. Marketing is just like performing <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/magic-of-marketing/"">magic tricks</a>, using technique, psychology, misdirection and entertainment to sell goods and services. In a monopolistic environment, there is no need to deceive the customer; there is no need to resort to deception as customers do not need to be recruited nor can they defect.

<h3>6. Abundance</h3>

Water being a natural resource that can only be produced from its chemical components at enormous cost, environmental sustainability is of immense importance. Many water companies propagate a negative message of scarcity instead of abundance, which creates frustration in communities.[note]Cooper, B., Burton, M., &amp; Crase, L. (2011). Urban water restrictions: attitudes and avoidance. <i>Water Resources Research</i>, <i>47</i>(12). doi:<a title=""Digital Object Identifier"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR010226"">10.1029/2010WR010226</a>.[/note] This issue relates back to my comments on inspiration. Although there technically is a scarcity of water, we need to focus on a positive message on how to maximise the value of available water through education of customers and pricing signals.

<h3>7. Collaboration</h3>

One of the defining aspects of services is that they are provided in cooperation between customer and service provider. In the case of water, the service is provided through the taps and plumbing owned by the customers. Both service provider and customer need to work together to ensure a high level of service.

<h2>The Eight Grace and beyond?</h2>

Lynn Serfafinn's <em>7 Graces</em> provide a systematic framework to help marketers make ethical choices. But are these the only values? Any value based system will never be complete. Additional dichotomies, for example, <em>injustice<97>justice</em> (treating all customers equally) or <em>apathy<em><97></em>empathy</em> (understanding customers), can be easily defined and justified. But it is up to the individual organisation which values it wants to focus on. The <em>7 Graces</em> is an inspiring book, written from a common sense perspective on how to provide value to customers without falling into the traps of the types of marketing used in consumer goods."
4130,bottled-water-marketing,Bottled Water Marketing <97> The Importance of the Place of Origin,"Bottled water is one of the greatest successes in marketing practices of the last century. Although <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">water utilities</a> in many countries sell water that is perfectly drinkable, bottled water companies have convinced the public that their <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/value-of-water/"">value proposition</a> is better than that of tap water.

In an old episode of the Australian show <em>Gruen Transfer</em>, panellists discussed why people are willing to pay so much more for bottled water than for tap water. Even though tap water provides the same benefits as bottled water, the price difference is gigantic. Marketing executive Russel Howcroft argued that this difference in price exists because water utilities are ""lazy marketers"".

Howcroft is correct that water Utilities generally have a weak <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-branding/"">brand</a> and judging by the opinions published on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-sentiment-analysis/"">Twitter</a>, people hold a negative sentiment towards tap water.

This article discusses a core ingredient of bottled water marketing to explain the high willingness to pay.

<h2>Bottled Water Marketing Strategy</h2>

One of the strategies often used in bottled water marketing is by emphasising the natural origins of their product. While bottled water advertising often shows beautiful mountains and pristine springs, water utilities prefer to advertise the technology they use to treat water. Whether these origin stories are true is doubtful. <a title=""Tap It Talk"" href=""http://www.tapitwater.com/blog/2013/01/nestle-sued-over-false-advertising-of-its-bottled-water.html"">Nestle has been sued</a> for falsely promoting the origin of bottled water, and researchers published a finding that tap water is inherently safer than bottled water.

[caption id=""attachment_838"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""700""]<img class=""wp-image-838 size-full"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2014/05/evian_1.jpg"" alt=""Bottled water companies focus on increasing affective involvement and the pristine origin or the product."" width=""700"" height=""455"" /> Bottled water companies focus on increasing affective involvement and the pristine origin or the product.[/caption]

Nestl<e9> is in trouble because its <93>spring water<94> source is municipal tap water. Nestl<e9>'s advertising campaign claims the contents of <a title=""Nestle Ice Mountain Water"" href=""http://www.icemountainwater.com/"">Ice Mountain Water</a> to be spring water, while it is distinctly referred to as <93>drinking water<94>, which is defined as <93>municipal water and well water<85><94><a0>in their documents. The water is further processed by Nestl<e9>'s treatment plants and branded with images of pristine glacial lakes and mountains.

This strategy is standard for bottled water companies. Given that tap water is identical to tap water, at 1000 times the price, bottled water companies need to increase the value proposition of their offering by emphasising how their product is different to tap water. A common strategy used by bottled water companies is to highlight the origin of the water and link it to increased benefits, such as health. Just look at <a title=""Fiji Water"" href=""http://www.fijiwater.com/"">Fiji Water</a>, <a title=""Evian"" href=""http://www.evian.com/"">Evian</a> and any other bottled water brand to see how they connect their water to a pristine natural environment.

[caption id=""attachment_245"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""833""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-245"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2012/11/Screenshot-from-2012-11-21-202316.png"" alt=""Bottled Water Marketing <97> The Importance of the Place of Origin"" width=""833"" height=""593"" /> Fiji water does not suffer from marketing myopia[/caption]

This strategy is very similar to the way toilet paper is sold. Advertising for <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-toilet-paper/"">toilet paper</a> creates an emotional connection with the product by emphasising a perfect lifestyle. Bottled water establishes this emotional connection by highlighting the health benefits of water through a connection with pristine natural surroundings.

Many water utilities don't implement origin strategies very well. Municipal water utilities are often focusing on treatment processes instead of the natural origin of their tap water. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/business-essentials-for-utility-engineers/"">Utility engineers</a> are proud of their achievement and love to tell their community about the technology needed to deliver drinkable water to each house. This strategy is set for failure because it emphasises the production process without any emotional attachment. Problems with the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/yuck-factor/"">acceptance of recycled sewage as drinking water</a> forcefully illustrate<a0>this point.

Water utilities could become less lazy by showing customers the natural origins of their water. In the end, all water comes from nature and tap water is as good, if not better, than bottled water."
344,tap-water-involvement,Tap Water Involvement: People don't care much about water,"Access to clean tap water is considered a human right as without it life would be impossible. But although water falls free from the sky, getting the water you need is not for free. In countries without reticulated water, people sometimes spend hours each day obtaining their water. In more developed countries obtaining water has been outsourced and people pay water utility companies to deliver clean water right at their doorstep. Given the importance of water for sustaining life you might think that most people care very much about tap water.

<h2>Consumer Involvement</h2>

In marketing, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">consumer involvement</a> is the construct used to measure how much consumers care about a product or service.[note]Zaichkowsky, J. L. (1994). The personal involvement inventory: Reduction, revision, and application to advertising. <i>Journal of Advertising</i>, <i>23</i>(4), 59.[/note] It is measured by asking people to tick a box on a scale between two extremes.

[caption id=""attachment_1355"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""567""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1355"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2013/01/PII.jpg"" alt=""Personal Involvement Inventory (Zaichowsky 1994)."" width=""567"" height=""288"" /> Personal Involvement Inventory (Zaichowsky 1994).[/caption]

In June last year I created an online survey to measure the <em>Personal Involvement Inventory</em> (PII) for tap water and invited people to complete it via Twitter. Thanks to <a title=""Only Tap Water"" href=""https://twitter.com/DrinkTapDotOrg"">@DrinkTapDotOrg</a>, <a title=""Help 4 Small Water"" href=""https://twitter.com/help4smallwater"">@Help4SmallWater</a>, <a title=""Tony Barnard"" href=""https://twitter.com/MagicTony"">@MagicTony</a> and <a title=""Charles Fishman"" href=""https://twitter.com/pprevos/status/215931161715810305"">@cfishman</a> for the help in getting respondents.

https://twitter.com/OnlyTapWater/status/215816482758737924

<h2>Tap Water Involvement</h2>

In total 77 responses were received (40% female, 60% male). Respondents were also asked whether they have a garden and whether they are professionally involved in tap water. The lowest possible PII score is 10 and the highest 50. The average score of this survey was 40.6, which is quite high<97>more than previously reported for mouthwash, but less then the involvement people have with cars.[note]Zaichkowsky, J. L. (1985). Measuring the involvement construct. <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>, <i>12</i>(3), 341<96>352.[/note] Interestingly, there were no significant differences based on gender, having a garden or being a water professional<97>all groups valued water equally.

The <em>Personal Involvement Inventory</em> has two dimensions: it measures a cognitive (rational) and an affective (emotional) involvement. The average cognitive involvement with tap water was 23.6<97>almost the maximum score of 25. This is not surprising given the importance of water. Affective involvement with water was much lower at 17.2. The difference between the two is statistically significant (t(76)=13.42, p&lt;10<sup>-6</sup>). However, also in the sub-factors, there is no significant difference between genders, gardening or profession.

Twitter is, however, not a representative sample and most tweets seem to originate from the younger generations. The research can also not be considered a representative sample as the invitation to complete the survey was re-tweeted mainly by water-related accounts. It can be assumed the people that follow these accounts have a higher level of involvement than regular tap water users. There is, however, no reason to assume that the relative difference between cognitive and affective involvement will be different in other population segments.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

What we can tentatively conclude from these results is that our emotional relationship with water is much lower than our rational understanding of its importance.

These results can have implications for how tap water is marketed by water utilities. Involvement is an important indicator that is related to willingness to pay. The more we are involved with a product or service, the more we are willing to pay.[note]Cohen, M. (2000). Consumer involvement<96>driving up the cost. <em>Consumer Policy Review</em>, <em>10</em>(4), 122<96>125[/note] Smart marketers thus use strategies to increase the level of involvement.

The reasons for the low level of involvement have to be sought in the <a title=""Marketing Myopia in Tap Water Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-myopia/"">marketing myopia </a>of tap water service providers. Some have even argued that tap water managers are <a title=""Are Tap Water Managers Lazy Marketers?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/lazy-marketers/"">lazy marketers</a>. To increase the level of involvement the message from water utilities needs to become more emotive, following the example of bottled water companies."
3008,cynical-manager,The Cynical Manager: The Organisation's Guard Dog,"The cynical manager has a bad name in business, and some even call them a <93><a title=""The Cynic is a Cancer in Your Organization"" href=""http://winthecustomer.com/the-cynic-is-a-cancer/"">cancer in your organisation</a><94>. In my view, most people are a bit too cynical about cynicism. Cynics are often valuable assets in corporations because they expose the 'new clothes' of management.[note]Dean Jr, J.W., Brandes, P. &amp; Dharwadkar, R. (1998). Organizational cynicism. <em>Academy of Management Review </em>(23) 341<96>52.[/note]

The word Cynic stems from the ancient Greek word for dog. The cynic might be a dog but is not a lapdog. The cynical manager can be the guard dog for organisations, protecting them from nonsense. Philosophical cynicism rejects conventional social values, such as business hierarchies. The cynic reflects on business practices from an external perspective and positively contributes by pointing out issues that might not be visible to their superiors. Being cynical is not necessarily a focus on negativity; it allows a view of the organisation outside of office politics.

<h2>The value of a cynical manager</h2>

Every manager should prefer a cynic over the pseudo-expert who is armed with uses<a0><a title=""Buzzword Bingo!"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/buzzword-bingo/"">buzzwords</a> without substance.<a0>Cynics often exasperate upper management by <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/socratic-management/"">questioning everything</a>, like a child they keep asking ""why"".<a0> More often than not, however, they know what is going on and see through the veil of ignorance.[note]Carlini, J. (1996). A trustworthy cynic.<i> Network World, </i><i>13</i>(42), 70<96>70.[/note]

Cynicism helps people to ensure that others don<92>t take advantage of them and it benefits organisations through resistance to potentially dangerous decisions.[note]Naus, F., van Iterson, A. &amp; Roe, R. Value incongruence, job autonomy, organisation-based self-esteem: A self-based perspective on organisational cynicism. <em>European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology</em>, 2007b, 16, 195<96>219.[/note] In one experiment, participants that were cynical towards their organisation were less likely to comply with unethical requests than those who were less cynical ((Andersson, L.M. &amp; Bateman, T.S. (1997). Cynicism in the workplace: Some causes and effects. <em>Journal of Organizational Behavior</em> 18, 449<96>469.[/note]

<h2>Types of cynicism</h2>

Not all cynical behaviour is, however, of equal value. Researchers have defined three types of cynics:

<ul>
    <li>Affective</li>
    <li>Cognitive</li>
    <li>Behavioural</li>
</ul>

In other words, you can be cynical as an emotional reaction, such as irritation, tension and anxiety.<a0>When you are cognitively cynical, you think<a0>that self-interest runs your organisation. When you are behaviourally cynical,<a0>you display that attitude in how you perform at work.[note]Kim, Tae-Yeol, Bateman, Thomas S.,<a0>Gilbreath Brad and Andserson, Lynne M. (2009).

1656,invisible-water-corporation,The Invisible Water Corporation. A New Definition of Service Quality,"Managers of tap water systems often struggle with the question of how you measure the level of service provided to customers. Most existing performance reporting systems are defined from an internal technical perspective, instead of a customer perspective. These methodologies view the water company from the perspective of the engineer and the accountant, instead of the perspective of the customer. For example, the IWA performance indicator system for water supply identifies 162 parameters to assess the performance of water supply, of which only about ten are defined from the customer<92>s point of view.[note]Cabrere, Haskins and Theuretzbacher-Fritz (2011). <em>Benchmarking Water Services. Guiding water utilities to excellence</em>. IWA Publishing and American Water Works Association.[/note] Developing a meaningful performance measurement system is a complicated exercise. As Cabrera et al. (2011) point out: ""performance assessment could be described as the art of simplification: the more condensed the data is, the better; but an excessive simplification of the picture may not provide sufficient information to make sound decisions.""

I am currently developing a customer-focused model to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-for-water-utilities/"">service quality</a> in tap water as part of a PhD research project on customer service in reticulated water services. This model is based on the hypothesis that customers have a low level of involvement and low willingness to pay for tap water. From this<a0>model it follows that the best possible service a utility can deliver is to make sure that customers can use water without ever having to think about it. In other words, the ideal water company is invisible to the customer.

The purpose of customer service is about providing value to the customer, as perceived by the customer. In the simplest terms: the perceived value of a service is the difference between perceived benefits and perceived costs of that service. From this<a0>relationship, it follows that the lower the cost of the service, the higher the value perceived by the customer.

Discussions about the cost of water are usually focused on money, but the cost of water, just like any other service, is multidimensional. Besides the financial cost, the customer also pays a psychological cost when things go wrong, a sociological cost when no water is available and the time it takes to acquire and use water.

Focusing on time cost, the worst possible water service exists in undeveloped countries, where women spend hours every day<a0>to get their daily ration of water. Women around the world<97>you rarely see men carrying water<97>collectively spend millions of hours every day in the pursuit of their daily water. The best possible level of water service is a well-managed tap water service where the amount of time needed to obtain water is limited to the amount of time the tap is open.

The core tenet of The Invisible Water Corporation is that the better the service that is provided by the Water Corporation, the less time and energy people have to spend purchasing and enjoying the service. When you open a tap, water comes out; when you flush the toilet, the bowl is empty; bills are easy to understand and so on.

There are two reasons people don't want to spend time and energy on water. The first is the concept of marginal utility, this is the idea that the perceived value of a service is determined by the least important use to the customer. Tap water suffers from a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">value paradox</a>. On the one hand, tap water is a life-sustaining liquid, while on the other hand it is flushed down the toilet.

Economic theory suggests that the willingness to pay is related to the marginal utility of a service. In other words, what people are willing to pay for in tap water is a waste transport medium and not drinking water. This can be illustrated by looking at the bottled water industry. They are able to charge insanely high prices for plain water. They can do this, among other reasons, because the marginal utility of bottled water is maximised as their product is only used for drinking.

Second reason willingness to pay for water is low is consumer involvement. Preliminary research among tap water users shows that although everybody agrees that water is important, they don<92>t really care about water. This has been confirmed by many customer surveys conducted by water companies. It is not uncommon for people to not even realise which company provides their tap water.

<h2>Invisible Water Corporation</h2>

The concept of the Invisible Water Corporation is best illustrated by describing what happens when a tap water service fails. You open a tap and no water comes out, or a bill arrives and the amount is wrong or the information provided is incomprehensible. The consumer pays in time and psychological energy for failures in the level of service provision of the water provider. Time is a quantifiable measure that can be used to develop a benchmarking model for the level of excellence of a tap water service provider.

While companies selling products are said to sell 'widgets', organisations that market services are in the business of selling 'moments of truth'. Each moment of truth is an opportunity that can lead to satisfaction, dissatisfaction or something in between. The average water company in an urbanised environment sells millions of moments of truth every day. Every single time a tap is opened, somebody calls the utility, opens a bill and so on is a moment of truth.

A water utility becomes invisible when every single moment of truth occurs without the consumer having to use more time than is required to enjoy the service, i.e. the amount of time it takes to use the water. The Invisible Water Corporation is a counterintuitive perspective on the value proposition of a water utility, but one that brings tap water service providers closer to their origainl purpose - provide a seamless service.

<blockquote>You have to deliver good quality services, but I don't get the concept that the customer is best placed to decide what those services are. They know they need pressure and they know if they don't have water out of their tap, but beyond that, they have only a small understanding of the what is required to run a safe and efficient water supply system.</blockquote>
The many engineers and scientists in water utilities that hold this view are wrong. Perhaps they need to follow a course in <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-for-engineers/"">marketing for engineers</a>.

These engineers assume that if the technical quality of service is sufficient, then customers will be happy. This assumption is not correct<97>the Gr<f6>nroos model of service quality shows that technical quality is only one aspect of the total customer experience.[note]Gr<f6>nroos, C. (1984). A service quality model and its marketing implications. <i>European Journal of Marketing</i>, <i>18</i>(4), 36<96>44. doi:<a title=""Link to article"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004784"">10.1108/EUM0000000004784</a>.[/note] To influence the total perceived quality, many non-technical parameters, such as public image and functional quality, need to be managed.

There is a significant paradigmatic difference between engineering and marketing. Engineering is based on predictable physical systems, while marketing builds on the inexact science of consumer behaviour and is predominately about managing perceptions. There are many examples where, even though technical quality is almost perfect, the understanding of consumers of the level of service is still small. This problem exists because the human dimension is not part of the equations that govern water systems.

One perfect example is the aesthetics of water. Although it makes no difference towards the actual safety of the water, consumer perception is that drinking water is colourless. Taste is another variable that is not easily controlled or measured through engineering. Research shows that water does not only influence the taste of water but moderated by environmental variables, such as the material of the cup.[note]Krishna, A., &amp; Morrin, M. (2008). Does touch affect the taste? The perceptual transfer of product container haptic cues. <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>, <i>34</i>(6), 807<96>818.[/note]

Perception is everything in marketing. This concept is also important in monopolies because publicly owned businesses are controlled by politicians who want to keep the voters happy. Having said this, a good friend of mine <a title=""The effects of Privatisation on Customer Satisfaction in the Water Supply Chain"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-privatisation/"">once stated</a> that <93>voter satisfaction is not a good proxy for customer satisfaction<94>. It could also be argued that all customers in a publicly owned system are all shareholders, and their views should be taken into consideration<97>any other opinion could be considered arrogant.
<blockquote>Water companies should be managed by marketers.</blockquote>
<h2>Water Utility Customer Focus</h2>
In my recent interviews with customer stakeholders in reticulated water, the voice of the customer indicates that they want to improve the focus on their needs. A clear theme in the data is the occasional disconnect between engineering and service staff. One respondent told me (paraphrasing): <93>water companies used to be run by engineers, now they are managed by accountants. In the future, they should be controlled by marketers<94>. In other words, we should account for the non-rationality of consumer behaviour.

The concept of bringing engineers and marketers together was beautifully expressed by Philip Kotler and Sidney Levy who writes that: ""Marketing is customer satisfaction <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/engineering-marketing-interface/"">engineering</a>"".[note]Kotler, P., &amp; Levy, S.

Everybody around the table nodded. The secretary noted another action in the board minutes and instructed the CEO to change the culture of the organisation.

Nobody knew what they wanted, all they knew was that something had to change. Because nobody knew what had to change, blaming the culture of the organisation for whatever was going wrong seemed like the best way forward. Not that anyone had any idea what organisational culture is, but judging by some of the inspiring articles in <a title=""Harvard Business Review"" href=""http://hbr.org"">Harvard Business Review</a> it seemed the best way to go.

Following the famous words by George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks, you either are with us and subscribe to these values, or you are an enemy of the organisation. Employees<a0>that criticise the new approach become the axis of evil. The consultant even drew a Bell Curve on a whiteboard to visualise that deviance from normality was from now on scorned upon. Thus began the new world order.

<blockquote>forcing normality destroys excellence and innovation</blockquote>

What the consultant didn't realise was that forcing people to normality within strict standard deviations is repression of spontaneity and destroys sources of excellence and innovation. When organisations force their employees in the same value pattern and no longer accept any deviance, they kill a significant source of improvement and innovation.

The link between organisational culture and business performance is strong, but both researchers and practitioners struggle to describe what a healthy culture is. A culture of obedience to a norm might be pleasant, but it will lead to organisational mediocrity.

Positive corporate deviance is a necessary condition for innovation and improvement to thrive. Only by nurturing those that think differently are organisations able to become remarkable."
1667,value-of-water,The Value of Water <97> A Marketing Perspective on Tap Water,"Father of economics Adam Smith identified the so-called <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">diamond-water paradox</a> in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>. This idea explains how some commodities without value in use, such as diamonds, have a high value in exchange and vice versa, water has a high<a0>use value but demands a low price. Smith acknowledges the common sense idea that water is valuable, but how valuable is<a0>water exactly?

The most straightforward definition of value is that it is the difference between perceived benefits and perceived cost. In this<a0>article, I propose a model to determine the value of water to customers based on marketing.

<h2>The Benefits of Water</h2>

To understand the value of water we need to define its benefits and distinguish between needs and wants for water. The marketing<a0>definition of needs and wants is very different from the common sense understanding of need as a necessity. The common sense understanding of water has a very limited view of what water is needed.

Based on Mallow's humanistic psychology, human beings need a lot more than just that which is needed to<a0>survive. Human<a0>beings have sociological needs and psychological needs, and they all have to be met. They are all necessary to be a<a0>complete human being. To say that water used for gardening is not a need but ""only a want"" is wrong.

People need water to grow their gardens<a0>because they have a sociological need or psychological need. People have a garden because they want to invite friends and have<a0>a good time. Gardening also provides a sense of achievement, a significant psychological need. Needs are a mental state<a0>of felt deprivation. There is no threshold whether something does or does not classify as a need. Needs are psychologically<a0>innate within us; they can not be changed or created.

Hand in hand with psychological needs, customers have 'wants', which is the manner in which a need is satisfied. If<a0>somebody needs self-fulfilment, some people might do a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/mba-marketing/"">PhD in marketing</a>; other people might enjoy working in their<a0>garden, for which they need water. Everybody fulfils their psychological needs differently. The core task of a service provider is<a0>to understand these needs and wants and create a value proposition that matches customer expectations.

Marketing can not change or create needs, but it can influence what people want. Wants are culturally determined and can<a0>be shaped through communication, and education. The traditional Aussie backyard is disappearing because customer's values<a0>are changing. People now are no longer interested in expressing themselves through their garden, possibly because the younger generation has experienced the prolonged drought and has developed alternative ways to satisfy their needs.

<h2>The Cost of Water</h2>

The other side of the value equation is cost. Far too much has been said about the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/price-of-water/"">price of water</a>, but most of this discourse<a0>is about money. However, the cost of water is multi-dimensional. Besides money, people pay a psychological price a sociological price and a time price for water.

The psychological price encompasses the mental effort customers need to expense in purchasing or consuming the service.<a0>With water, the psychological cost is generally marginal, but as soon as the service fails, the psychological price increases<a0>dramatically, thereby decreasing the perceived value and leading to unhappy customers.

Another aspect is the sociological price, which<a0>relates to how the purchase impacts how other people view us. Sociological cost is relevant to water users in that,<a0>for example owning a lovely garden or swimming pool enhances the customer's prestige in their social network.

The type of price that I want to focus a bit more on is time. People need to spend their time to obtain water, and around the world,<a0>things are very different. The worst possible water service imaginable you would find, for example, in arid parts of Africa where<a0>women spend hours every day to get their daily ration of water.

There are some estimates that <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/07/484793736/millions-of-women-take-a-long-walk-with-a-40-pound-water-can"">women around the </a>world, you never see men carrying water, spend about 200 million hours every day to obtain water. In developed<a0>countries, the amount of time needed to get water is negligible, except in cases of service failure when customers need to<a0>spend extra time or delay their activities because water is not available or not of potable quality and needs to be boiled.

<h2>The Value of Water and the Tap Water Value Proposition</h2>

Understanding how your customers assess the value of a service is the first step in developing a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-value-proposition/"">value proposition</a><a0>enhances customer experience. Water is an exciting service because in developed countries it is taken for granted. The<a0>price of water, monetary, psychological, sociological and time, is so low that any disturbance in the value equation will lead<a0>to dissatisfaction. This thought leads to a previous proposition I made on this blog; the best possible water utility is <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">invisible to the<a0>customer</a>. An invisible water utility provides services that are so seamless that customers pay a negligible time price."
3102,middle-management-stress,Middle management stress: What can we learn from animals?,"The great <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/value-based-management/"">Aristotle</a> wrote more than two millennia ago that man and women are social animals. More recently, Charles Darwin made us realise that we have more in common with monkeys than we wish to admit.

Recent research has strengthened this idea by showing that middle management<a0>stress is a natural occurrence as it also occurs among Barbary macaques.[note]Edwards, K. L., Walker, S. L., Bodenham, R. F., Ritchie, H., &amp; Shultz, S. (2013). Associations between social behaviour and adrenal activity in female Barbary macaques: Consequences of study design. <i>General and Comparative Endocrinology</i>, 186(1), 72<96>79. <a title=""Associations between social behaviour and adrenal activity in female Barbary macaques"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.02.023"" rel=""noopener"">doi:10.1016/j.ygcen.2013.02.023</a>.[/note]

Although there are many advantages to working in organisations, social conflict is often a source of stress. Subordinate members of the team receive more aggression from higher ranked individuals and experience higher stress levels as a consequence. Katie Edwards showed that monkeys at the <a title=""Trentham Monkey Forest"" href=""http://www.monkey-forest.com/"" rel=""noopener"">Trentham Monkey Forest</a> in the middle of the hierarchy were involved with conflict from both individuals below them as well as above them, whereas those in the bottom of the hierarchy distance themselves from conflict. The middle ranking macaques were more likely to challenge, and be challenged by, those higher on the social ladder, causing them stress in the process.

<h2>Avoid middle management stress</h2>

Knowing that middle management stress is a natural phenomenon and observed in primate behaviour does not mean that we should only accept it as a fact of life. The paper also describes how different animal species developed coping mechanisms to deal with their stressful lives. In <a title=""Olive Baboon"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_baboon"" rel=""noopener"">olive baboons</a>, subordinate males that redirect aggression towards another baboon following a conflict had lower stress levels compared to those that did not do so. Another coping mechanism is social buffering; the social support from other members of the group, which has been demonstrated in <a title=""Greylag Goose"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylag_Goose"" rel=""noopener"">greylag geese</a>.

Direct support reduces the impact of stress, including close grooming relationships during times of social instability, and post-conflict consolation. Although I don't advocate physically grooming your colleges experiencing stress, you should ensure that you look after middle management in your organisation and avoid high levels of stress.

434,water-quality-paradox,The Water Quality Paradox and Perceptions of Service Quality,"Every day, thousands of engineers around the world work hard every day to provide potable <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-quality-index/"">water quality</a> to their customers thereby keeping cities liveable and preventing disease. They do this work invisible to most people as customers have very simple, but very high expectations of service.

Although in well-managed systems, the chances that somebody does not receive an excellent service through their tap are extremely low, consumer perception of these services is often not as good as engineers would hope for. The reason for this is because there is a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">paradox</a> in the provision of water services. Operators of drinking water systems are required to comply with local regulatory requirements. Meeting these requirements can, however, lead to a reduction in service quality. For example, adding chlorine is essential to ensure public health in that it destroys micro-organisms. In some communities, however, chlorine is perceived as an unwanted chemical, leading to a reduction in service quality.[note]Kot, M., Castleden, H., &amp; Gagnon, G. A. (2011). <a title=""Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities"" href=""http://archive.org/details/StudyOverview-UnintendedConsequencesOfRegulationOnRuralWaterOperators"">Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities</a>: Examples from Atlantic Canada. <i>Health &amp; Place</i>, <i>17</i>(5), 1030<96>1037. doi:10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.06.012.[/note] The water quality paradox is one of the main issues faced by water utilities. A case in point is the resistance against adding fluoride to water, such as explained in this video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VmAWmSMbWM

One of the main ways people form their perceptions of tap water is through taste. A simple search on ""tap water"" on <a title=""Sentiments towards Tap Water in 140 Characters"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-sentiment-analysis/"">Twitter</a> shows that taste is the main concern. The taste of water is, however, influenced not only by the chemical and biological quality of the water itself but also by other circumstances, such as the cup people drink it from.[note]Krishna, A., &amp; Morrin, M. (2008). Does touch affect the taste? The perceptual transfer of product container haptic cues. <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>, <i>34</i>(6), 807<96>818.[/note] It was found that the firmness of a cup in which water is served might affect consumers<92> judgments of the water itself.

<h2>Water Quality Paradox</h2>

The water quality paradox implies that we can not influence the total experience of the service enjoyed by customers as there are always aspects outside the control of the service provider. What at first seems like a paradox is, however, not paradoxical. Water services are like internet services, as they are provided at the customer's premises and they use their equipment to consume the service. The paradox in water quality is caused by the fact that we cannot control all variables that make up the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/perception-of-water-quality/"">customer experience</a>. To the customer, however, this is not important, and any service failure will reflect negatively on the service provider.

This problem is one of the issues I am currently researching for my <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1959.9/561679"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">PhD thesis</a> and will soon start collecting data to dig deeper into this issue."
471,tap-water-value-proposition,The Tap Water Value Proposition,"Deliberations about the value water seem at first instance to be a foregone conclusion. Water is of infinite value because we need water just like we need air and food to stay alive. This is, however, a simplistic view as we only need a relatively small amount to sustain life, anything beyond that is discretionary. In this article I will describe the complexities of the the value of water as a construct and propose an alternative perspective to define it. From this layered definition of value we can start defining the value proposition of water to improve customer engagement in tap water.

<h2>The Value of Water</h2>

The value of water is not the same as the <a title=""The Price of Water in Ancient Literature"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/price-of-water/"">price of water</a> because price is an absolute concept, whereas value is inherently subjective construct that can only be defined from the customer's perspective. It is often said that <a title=""<93>Waiter, there is a fly in my soup<94><97>When Customer Service Goes Wrong"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/fly-in-my-soup/"">the customer is always right</a>. Although customers might be wrong about facts, they are always right about how they feel about something. In order to use the concept of value in marketing we need to view it from the perspective of the customer, which relates to how they feel about the service. Following this line of reasoning, value can be defined as the difference between the <em>perceived benefits</em> and <em>perceived</em> <em>cost</em>. We should, however, not view benefits and cost only from a monetary perspective. The value of water is a multi-dimensional construct.

<h2>Consumer Benefits</h2>

In 1776 Adam Smith identified the so called <a title=""Paradox of value (Wikipedia)"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value"">diamond-water paradox</a>.[note]Smith, A. [1776] (2010). <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>. Capstone.[/note] This paradox is based on the idea that some useless commodities, such as diamonds, demand a high price and vice versa, water is very useful, but demands a low price.[note]Levy, D. (1982). Diamonds, water, and Z goods: an account of the paradox of value. <em>History of Political Economy</em>, 14(3), 312<96>322; Robertson, H. M., &amp; Taylor, W. L. (1957). Adam Smith<92>s approach to the theory of value. <em>The Economic Journal</em>, 67(266), 181<96>198.[/note] Not all water use is, however, a matter of life and death. Water is used for many purposes and in the case of reticulated water supply, the same water is used for drinking, hygiene, gardens, swimming and other recreational activities and as a transport medium for waste.

<a title=""Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"">Maslow<92>s Hierarchy of Needs</a> can be evoked to illustrate the multidimensional nature of the value of water.[note]Maslow, A. H. (1943). A theory of human motivation. <em>Psychological Review</em>, 50(4), 370<96>396.[/note] At the physiological level, water is needed for hygiene and hydration. Water does, however, also fulfil social and psychological needs. A mundane activity such as gardening, which requires a lot of water, serves to meet the full spectrum of human needs, e.g. physical exercise, expressing creativity and creating a space to socialise.[note]Solomon, M. R., Russell-Bennett, R., &amp; Previte, J. (2010). <em>Consumer Behaviour: Buying, Having, Selling</em>. Frenchs Forest, N.S.W.: Pearson.[/note]

Many publications on tap water make a distinction is made between the water we <em>need</em> and the water we <em>want</em>, the so called discretionary use. This distinction is based on a common-sense distinction between needs and wants, whereby needs are considered of a higher order than wants. The common sense understanding of the difference between needs and wants is, however, incorrect as it denies the importance of higher order needs. Maslow, as a <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanistic_psychology"">humanist psychologist</a>, believed that all human beings have a need for self-actualisation as much as they need food and water<97>the so called hierarchy of needs is not really a hierarchy. Physiological needs are just as important as the need for a sense of safety, a sense of belonging, self-esteem and self-actualization. Therefore, the need for water includes uses other that hygiene and consumption. Recognising that sociological and psychological needs are just as important as physiological needs is paramount to be able to define the value proposition of water.

<h2>Consumer Cost</h2>

On the cost side of the value equation, dimensions other than financial cost, such as time cost should be taken into consideration.[note]Sweeney, J. C., &amp; Soutar, G. N. (2001). Consumer perceived value: The development of a multiple item scale. <em>Journal of Retailing</em>, 77(2), 203<96>220.[/note] Additional to the money a customer pays for service, they also pay with their time. Using time to enjoy a service is an opportunity cost to the customer<97>any time expenditure reduces their available discretionary time. A service provider can increase the value perceived by the customer by minimising the amount of time required to enjoy the service.[note]Davies, G., &amp; Omer, O. (1996). Time allocation and marketing. <em>Time &amp; Society</em>, 5(2), 253<96>268. <a title=""Time allocation and marketing. Time &amp; Society"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0961463X96005002007"">doi:10.1177/0961463X96005002007</a>.[/note]

This concept can be used to measure quality of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-for-water-utilities/"">service delivery</a>. The worst level of service occurs in countries women walk for hours to obtain their family's daily amount of water. In developed reticulated water systems, the time investment by consumers is marginal and only becomes noticeable in the case of service failures or with inefficient facilitating services such as billing.[note]Williams, R. F. G., &amp; Mountjoy, N. (2012). Seeing water in a spatial and temporal perspective: the residential demand for water in regional Victoria. Presented at the 41th Conference of Economists, Melbourne, Australia: School of Economics, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Australia.[/note] The value perceived by customers can be maximised by minimising their perceived cost, minimising the amount of time they need to invest in enjoying a water service.

<h2>The Tap Water Value Proposition</h2>

With this multi-layered concept of the value of water we can define a meaningful tap water <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-advertising/"">value proposition</a><97>a promise to the customer regarding the value of the provided service. The value proposition is not limited to a slogan or a branding exercise. A meaningful value proposition is communicated in everything a service provider writes says and more importantly, does<97>within the tap water context, customer service stretches from catchment to tap and to the water bill.

There are only two ways to maximise the value perceived by the customer: increase the perceived benefits or decrease the perceived cost. To maximise the perceived benefits of the service offering, water companies should focus their communication on the higher order needs water use satisfies. Many water utilities highlight the technological aspects of service provision, instead of the higher order benefits it provides.

The other side of the value equation involves lowering perceived cost. To lower the perceived cost of water services it is important to provide a high level of service in order to minimise the time price paid by customers. Water companies can focus on finding the root cause of customer communications and seeking to eradicate these causes so that there is no more need for consumers to contact the organisation. The perfect water utility is <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">invisible to the customer</a>. The slide show below provides some examples on how the intangible value of water can be communicated, beyond relying on pipe, pumps and plants.

A psychopath does not have to be a knife-wielding mass murdering maniac. Most of them are charming and intelligent, but lack empathy and are willing to sacrifice ethics to achieve personal goals. They can impress in interviews, but their lack of understanding creates tension in organisations, which in the long run leads to reduced performance.[note]Babiak, P. (2006). <i>Snakes in suits: when psychopaths go to work</i>. New York: Regan Books.[/note]

So it seems that Spock was wrong. Being either good or evil bears no relationship to the level of performance. We should once again focus on good management instead of leadership. The leadership experiment has failed and has not created better organisations. Management is the key to good organisations. Management can be defined, and its outcomes can be measured, while leadership will forever be contested and its effects are unable to be measured.

4285,yuck-factor,The Yuck Factor: The Psychology of Drinking Recycled Water,"Using sewage to create drinking water, or recycled water is a controversial topic in many parts of the world, especially in places where drought has forced utilities<a0>to develop alternative sources of tap water. In 2006 the Australian city of Toowoomba faced an extreme water supply problem and held a <a title=""Sydney Morning Herald: Toowoomba says no to recycled water"" href=""http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/toowoomba-says-no-to-recycled-water/2006/07/29/1153816419568.html"">referendum</a> asking its citizens whether recycled water should be added to the potable supply. This referendum led to emotional outbursts, and the proposal was eventually rejected. Some commentators on this event referred to the so-called <91>yuck factor<92>, which is an emotional reaction of repugnance towards certain foods and medicines. This article explores a psychological mechanism that causes this response and provides some suggestions<a0>on how to effectively promote the idea of using sewage to create drinking water.

<h2>The importance of origin</h2>

From a marketing point of view, using treated sewage to create drinking water is a proposition that 's <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/direct-potable-reuse/"">hard to sell to customers</a>. The <a title=""Bottled Water Marketing <97> The Importance of Origin"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/bottled-water-marketing/"">origin of water</a> is the most important aspect of the marketing of water, a concept masterfully used by bottled water companies. The importance of the<a0>(perceived) source of water was illustrated in a study which investigated whether there is a difference in willingness to pay depending on the name of water service. The research found that customers had a higher willingness to pay for <93><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/weasel-words/"">recycled water</a><94> than for <93>treated wastewater<94>.[note]Menegaki, A. N., Mellon, R. C., Vrentzou, A., Koumakis, G., &amp; Tsagarakis, K. P. (2009). What<92>s in a name: Framing treated wastewater as recycled water increases willingness to use and willingness to pay. <i>Journal of Economic Psychology</i>, <i>30</i>(3), 285<96>292. <a title=""Willingness to pay for recycled water versus treated sewage"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joep.2008.08.007"">doi:10.1016/j.joep.2008.08.007</a>.[/note] Although the study indicates that there are differences in valuation based on the perceived origin of the water, no<a0>explanation was provided for this phenomenon.

<h2>The psychology of disgust</h2>

There is no rational reason to oppose using sewage to create tap water. Regardless of technology, the natural water cycle ensures that all sewage will eventually become fresh water and most likely will find its way to somebody's tap. Human psychology is, however, more complicated than this simple rational line of<a0>thought.

Our deep-seated negative overall attitude towards faeces<a0>leads us to maintain a negative attitude towards anything that is related to it, including recycled water. Rationally speaking, this is a fallacy and known as the <em>Wisdom of Repugnance</em>, or the <a title=""Yuck Factor on Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuck_factor"">yuck factor</a>.<a0> People arguing against recycled water use a non-rational <91>appeal to disgust<92>. They believe that a natural negative response to something should be interpreted as evidence for the intrinsically dangerous character of that thing. Although this is not considered a rational argument, it is nevertheless valid because we cannot ignore our innate psychological drives.

The psychological mechanism at work is the well-known principle of <a title=""Classical Conditioning on Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"">classical conditioning</a>, also known as the <em>Pavlov Reflex</em>. Our cultural surroundings largely condition our tastes. Psychologists have researched these issues in detail. Faeces are a universal disgust substance that is deeply seated within our psychological make-up. This disgust is, however, not innate<97>we develop this feeling of disgust through conditioning.[note]Rozin, P., Haidt, J., &amp; McCauley, C.R. (2008). Disgust in M. Lewis, J.M. Haviland-Jones &amp; L.F. Barrett (eds.), <em>Handbook of emotions</em>, 3rd ed. (pp. 755<96>776). New York: Guilford Press.[/note]

What we see in this experiment is that the context in which the bowl is placed influences the<a0>attractiveness of the soup. None of the changes to the soup did, however, rationally modify the soup in any way. This experiment is based on the same principle behind the idea to use a<a0>special spoon<a0>to serve food to your pet<97>there is no rational reason to do so, but the perception of disgust is strong enough to motivate people to buy special spoons for their pets.

This experiment can<a0>be repeated using<a0>different water scenarios: straight from a spring, from a treatment plant, sourced from sewerage, downstream of a sewerage treatment plant and so on. This type of research should be conducted as it would assist<a0>utilities to sell better the proposition of using purified sewerage as drinking water.

<h2>Marketing recycled water</h2>

Although repugnance is a deep-seated psychological mechanism, the precise nature of the disgust mechanism is culturally determined. Just because a psychological mechanism is at work does not mean that it is hard-wired in our brain. Classically conditioned responses can be extinguished and reprogrammed. This change can, however, not be achieved by appealing to reason, as some industry experts proclaim.[note]Russell, S., &amp; Lux, C. (2009).

The marketing of recycled water is a <a title=""The Delicate Art of Promoting Recycled Water"" href=""http://www.environmentalleader.com/2011/04/18/the-delicate-art-of-promoting-recycled-water/"">delicate art</a>. The repugnance against faeces is too deeply seated to be extinguished by reason alone. The most effective advertising to change attitudes does not appeal to reason<97>don't try to convince your customers by telling them how great your treatment plants are. The best analogies to this problem are anti-smoking or safe driving campaigns. The most effective campaigns<a0>are those that appeal to non-rational aspects of smoking or speeding.

Given the intense disgust related to sewerage, telling people that they should drink and shower in recycled<a0>water will immediately activate the Pavlovian disgust reflex. The most effective way to sell the<a0>idea of using sewerage to create potable is to increase the level of trust customers have in the organisation, using origin strategies. Don't emphasise the sewerage aspect of the water or the high-tech treatment facilities<97>emphasise the natural water cycle by using emotive images of pristine water flows. Focusing on the non-rational aspects of water consumption will increase customers' involvement with utilities and ultimately have a positive influence on their perceptions of quality and trust in the organisation.[note]Cohen (2000).

4286,asset-performance-customer-experience,From Asset Performance to Customer Experience in Water Utilities,"Judging by the available publications and conference papers, the water industry is dominated by <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/engineering-marketing-interface/"">engineers,</a> scientists and economists, with much less attention given to research into customer service. The application of marketing theories to provide value to customers of water utilities is an under-researched area given the monopoly status of service providers. The purpose of this presentation is to share some of the results of this research on the relationship between engineering and customer satisfaction.

A <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">paradox</a> appears to exist in the provision of reticulated water services. Providing service at a high level of technical proficiency is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to ensure customer satisfaction. To further research this problem, several stakeholder organisations of reticulated water customers have been interviewed to investigate the factors determining customer-centric service provision. These interviews revealed that a <91>professional orientation<92> could exist, obstructing the creation of positive customer experience. Focusing on the professional aspects of service delivery (engineering, finance, procedures and politics) carries the risk of losing sight of the human dimension, leading to dissatisfaction.

<blockquote>Technology is predictable; consumer behaviour is unpredictable</blockquote>

<h2>From Asset Performance to Customer Experience</h2>

The core of the issue is that technology and science are predictable?engineering problems can be solved in neat equations?while human behaviour is more complicated and cannot be captured in models and equations. Tensions between marketing and engineering have been extensively researched in the manufacturing industry, but not in service provision. More detailed research is being conducted, collecting data from water utilities to investigate further the relationship between customer service and engineering.

In this presentation, the preliminary results of this research will be outlined. Based on these findings, a model for experiential marketing of water services is proposed, which moves away from a focus on asset performance to a focus on customer experience.

3254,boardroom-jester,The Boardroom Jester | The Teller of Organisational Truth,"In medieval times, the <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester"" rel=""noopener"">jester</a> played a significant role in influential circles. Jesters, a precursor to the modern-day clown, wore bright, motley-patterned costumes and entertained the rich and powerful with their antics. Their role was not only to amuse but also to challenge their master and guests in their thinking. Jesters used to be a mirror of society, using satire to provoke the current status.

The jester played an essential role in society because he was able to provide a unique perspective on current affairs. They were able to be critical without being concerned about internal politics and personal sensitivities. In doing so, they walked a fine line, because not being severe enough or being too critical could land them in serious trouble.

<h2>The Boardroom Jester</h2>

Court jesters have disappeared from our cultural landscape, but it is time to bring this character back to the boardroom. I propose that major organisations hire a boardroom jester. The jester is allowed to attend all proceedings, say anything without punishment and use satire to hold a mirror to the people in power. The Boardroom Jester helps management to think <93>outside the box<94> by being an intellectual Jack-in-the-Box. An effective boardroom jester practices <a title=""The Importance of Cynicism: The Organisation<92>s Guard Dog"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/cynical-manager/"">philosophical cynicism</a>, rejecting social conventions and using humour to reveal the naked truth.

Unfortunately, most managers take themselves far too seriously. People in senior management positions<97>these days referred to as <a title=""Leadership is Evil: Inspiration from Star Trek"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/evil-leadership/"">leaders</a><97>are often disconnected from what happens in their organisations. Staff are reluctant to speak about the details because of the fear the repercussions. Officially sanctioned jesters can hide behind their silly costumes and foolishness to ask the questions that others are afraid to ask. The Boardroom Jester does not form part of the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/subservient-manager/"">illusion of hierarchy</a>, so there is never any fear of damaging career prospects.

The idea of hiring people that can challenge current thinking is being frustrated by contemporary recruitment practices. Organisations seek people to fit into their carefully chose set of <a title=""The Value of Value Based Management"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/value-based-management/"">values</a>, rather than people that <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">deviate from normality</a>."
122,servaqua,SERVAQUA: Towards a service quality model in potable reticulated water services,"A range of methodologies to measure the level of service provided by water utilities is used in the industry.

A conceptual model was developed based on a synthesis of literature on service quality and water supply. The face- and content validity of the model are assessed using a qualitative case-study approach in which the views of organisations representing customers in this industry were sought.

In this paper, a model for assessing service quality in reticulated water is proposed which takes the specific characteristics of water supply into account.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The provision of tap water is a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-privatisation/"">natural monopoly</a>, which exists in most markets for networked services, such as telecommunication, transport, electricity, gas and sanitation and occurs when <93>due to the economies of scale of a particular industry, the maximum efficiency of production and distribution is realised through a single supplier<94>.[note]DiLorenzo, T. J. (1996). The myth of natural monopoly. <em>The Review of Austrian Economics</em>, 9(2), 43<96>58.[/note] Distinguishing issue for services provided in a natural monopoly is that dissatisfied customers cannot change service provider. This issue impacts how water utilities manage their customers; without the threat of defection, there is no intrinsic motivation for the organisation to maximise service quality.[note]Flynn, N. (1990). <em>Public sector management</em>. London: Harvester Wheatsheaf.[/note] Monopolised service provision and the associated absence of consumer choice has necessitated the regulation of such markets, often through so-called <91>yard-stick competition<92>, where the performance of monopolistic service providers as compared with peer organisations in similar markets.[note]Braadbaart, O. (2007). Collaborative benchmarking, transparency and performance: Evidence from The Netherlands water supply industry. <em>Benchmarking: An International Journal</em>, 14(6), 677<96>692.[/note]

These regulatory frameworks have driven many water utilities to initiate customer service programs. These are, however, often dictated by the reporting requirements of the regulator rather than by an internally motivated customer-focus imperative.[note]Karbowiak, P. (2003). Marketing a technical business. <em>Water Supply</em>, 3(1-2), 433<96>440.[/note] A range of methodologies to implement performance measurement of reticulated water services exists,[note]Berg, S. V. (2010). <em>Water Utility Benchmarking: Measurement, Methodologies and Performance Incentives</em>. London: IWA Publishing; Cabrera, E. (2011). Benchmarking Water Services: Guiding Water Utilities to Excellence. London: IWA Publishing.[/note] most of which focus on the intrinsic quality of water supply, they concentrate on technical parameters such as chemical composition and electrical conductivity, which are measured from the perspective of the service provider. These methodologies are problematic because they mostly omit the quality of service as experienced by the customer, limiting their ability to drive customer-focused management. The literature on service quality in networked services is sparse, with only one empirically tested model for service quality developed for reticulated water.[note]Babakus, E. (1993). Measuring service quality in the public utilities. <em>Journal of Nonprofit</em> <em>&amp; Public Sector Marketing</em>, 1(1), 33<96>49. doi:<a title=""Measuring service quality in the public utilities. Journal of Nonprofit &amp; Public Sector Marketing"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J054v01n01_04"">10.1300/J054v01n01_04</a>.[/note] This methodology is, however, incomplete as it focuses on the supplementary services provided by water utilities, omitting consumer perceptions of core services.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-for-water-utilities/"">conceptual model for total service quality</a> in the provision of networked technological services, dominated by physical elements, with particular reference to reticulated water for customers in urban environments. A conceptual model is derived from a synthesis of literature on services quality. The face and content validity of the model is assessed using a qualitative case-study approach in which the views of organisations representing customers in this industry were sought. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research into this problem.

<h2>Background</h2>

The supply chain for water and sanitation services is a closed system that forms part of the natural hydrological cycle.[note]Grigg, N. S. (2012). <em>Water, Wastewater and Stormwater Infrastructure Management</em> (2nd ed.). International Water Association.[/note] Water in its natural environment has limited usability for customers in an urbanised setting as it is not fit for human consumption. The service provider extracts water from the natural environment and adds value through purification and pressurisation of the natural resource, delivering the final product to the customer's premises. Customers use water and subsequently return it to the natural environment.

The provision of tap water is a service as customers only purchase the right to use the water and pay for the value added by the service provider. The water itself does not change ownership since the natural water cycle forces it back to the environment through evaporation or natural water flows. Consumption of water is thus defined by a reduction in quality of the technical parameters salient to customers: purity and pressure.[note]Zetland, D. (2011). <em>The End of Abundance: Economic Solutions to Water Scarcity</em>. Amsterdam and Mission Viejo: Aguanomics Press.[/note] After the customer has used the water, it is dispersed back into the natural environment at a level of quality lower than potable water. Unlike other products, water is returned to its original state as a raw product through technological and natural processes; ready to be harvested and included into the next value stream, closing the natural water cycle.

Tangible elements dominate reticulated water as a service as the water is a physical product, making it high in experience qualities, i.e. the customer can assess the level of service through their experience.[note]Rushton, A. M., &amp; Carson, D. J. (1985). The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles. <em style=""background-color: #f5f6f5;"">European Journal of Marketing</em>, 19(3), 19<96>40. doi:<a style=""background-color: #f5f6f5;"" title=""The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles.

Water services also contain credence qualities, which are attributes which customers find impossible to evaluate, in part because they do not possess the knowledge or skills to do so.[note]Rushton &amp; Carson, 1985.[/note] Credence qualities in reticulated water are of particular importance concerning the chemical and biological composition of the water required to maintain public health.

Reticulated water is provided at arm's length from the service provider as the water is directly delivered to the customer's premises. The service can as such can be classified as a service factory. These are services with a small degree of human interaction, minimal options for customisation, low labour intensity and a higher ability to manage heterogeneity then other types of services.[note]Schmenner, R. W. (1986). How can service businesses survive and prosper? <em>Sloan Management Review</em>, 27(3), 21<96>32.[/note] The only interaction between staff and the customer occurs in situations of exceptions, i.e. updating customer information, billing or service recovery. These characteristics do, however, only apply to the core service provided by water utilities, i.e. the actual water as supplied to the customer's tap. The supplementary services, such as information provision, billing and complaints handling,[note]Gr<f6>nroos, C. (1984). A service quality model and its marketing implications. <em>European Journal of Marketing</em>, 18(4), 36<96>44. doi:<a title=""A service quality model and its marketing implications. European Journal of Marketing"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004784"">10.1108/EUM0000000004784</a>; Lovelock, C. H. (1992).

Aix-en-Provence, France: IAE, Universit<e9> d<92>Aix-Marseille III.[/note] require a much higher degree of interaction between service provider and customer and are in fact the only time when the customer directly interacts with the service provider. These characteristics are important considerations in defining a model for service quality of potable reticulated water, as proposed below.

<h2>Service Quality Models</h2>

Service quality is a model of how customers perceive the quality of service provision.[note]Zeithaml, V., Berry, L. L., &amp; Parasuraman, A. (1993). The nature and determinants of customer expectations of service. <em>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</em>, 21(1), 1<96>12.[/note] Understanding how services are evaluated is of importance as it will enable the organisation to influence these evaluations in the desired direction.[note]Gr<f6>nroos, C. (1990). <em>Service management and marketing: Managing the moments of truth in service competition</em>. Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books.[/note] Service quality is of academic and managerial importance because of its apparent relationship to costs, profitability, customer satisfaction and positive word of mouth. Service quality is widely regarded as a driver of corporate marketing and financial performance.[note]Buttle, F. (1996). SERVQUAL: Review, critique, research agenda. <em>European Journal of Marketing</em>, 30(1), 8<96>32; Carrillat, F. A., Jaramillo, F., &amp; Mulki, J. P. (2007).

A., Delene, L. M., &amp; Lyth, D. M. (1990). A synthesised service quality model with managerial implications. <em>International Journal of Service Industry Management</em>, 1(1), 27<96>45. doi:<a title=""A synthesised service quality model with managerial implications.

<h3>Anglo-Saxon Model</h3>

The ubiquitous SERVQUAL gap-model approach dominates the discourse on service quality.[note]Parasuraman, A., Zeithaml, V., &amp; Berry, L. L. (1988). SERVQUAL: A multiple-item scale for measuring consumer perceptions of service quality. <em>Journal of Retailing</em>, 64(1), 12<96>40.[/note] In this model, service quality is conceptualised as a gap between what the customer expects from a class of service providers, e.g. all hotels, and their evaluation of the performance of a particular service provider,[note]Buttle, 1996[/note], e.g. The Langham Hotel. The SERVQUAL construct consists of five dimensions, i.e., reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy and responsiveness, four of which are related to intangible elements of service provision.

[caption id=""attachment_201"" align=""alignnone"" width=""510""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-201"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2012/11/SERVQUAL.jpg"" alt=""Figure 2: Determinants of Service Quality (Parasuraman et al. 1988)."" width=""510"" height=""333"" /> Determinants of Service Quality (Parasuraman et al. 1988).[/caption]

The presuppositions of the SERVQUAL model have repeatedly been criticised.[note]Buttle, 1996[/note] Firstly, there is evidence that the five dimensions of the construct have a high degree of intercorrelation. Research in a water utility by Babakus in 1993 produced a single factor model of service quality instead of the traditional five factors. Possible explanations of this are mainly related to the nature of reticulated water as a service, is a low involvement service factory. The service quality construct might be factorially complex in some industries, but uni-dimensional in other industries. Service quality measurement should thus be context specific, accounting for the characteristics of the service under consideration. The generic model needs tailoring to industry-specific circumstances and several alternative models, building on the SERVQUAL methodology, have been developed over the years, such as HEdPERF in higher education and LibQUAL+ in libraries.[note]Abdullah, F. (2005). HEdPERF versus SERVPERF: The quest for an ideal measuring instrument of service quality in the higher education sector. <em>Quality Assurance in Education</em>, 13(4), 305<96>328. doi:<a title=""HEdPERF versus SERVPERF: The quest for ideal measuring instrument of service quality in higher education sector. Quality Assurance in Education"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09684880510626584"">10.1108/09684880510626584</a>; Cook, C., Heath, F., &amp; Thompson, B. (2002). LibQUAL+ One instrument in the new measures toolbox. <em>Journal of Library Administration</em>, 35(4), 41<96>46. doi:<a title=""LibQUAL+ One instrument in the new measures toolbox. Journal of Library Administration"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J111v35n04_09"">10.1300/J111v35n04_09</a>.[/note]

Secondly, the dimensions of SERVQUAL are weighted towards the intangible aspects of a service, which makes it less suitable for services dominated by tangible elements where the customer is better able to assess the quality of the service directly. The last objection to SERVQUAL germane to this paper is that the gap model focuses on the process of service delivery, ignoring the outcomes of the service encounter.[note]Buttle, 1996[/note] Although the gap model recognises that actual service delivery influences perceived service quality, the model only measures the gap between expected service and perceived service, ignoring the gap between actual service delivery and perceived service delivery.

<h3>Nordic Model</h3>

In the Nordic model of service quality, popularised by Christiaan Gr<f6>nroos, total perceived service quality is the outcome of an evaluation process where the customer compares context specific expectations of quality with the experienced quality. The expectations of quality are context-specific to the firm under consideration and not based on the total class of service providers, as is the case in the Anglo-Saxon model. The expected service is influenced by the marketing activities of the service provider and external forces, such as word-of-mouth, corporate image and customer needs.

In the Nordic model, the outcome of the service and the process of service delivery are both recognised as forming part of the experienced quality. The inseparability of production and consumption characterises services, and the outcome of this manufacturing process is that which the consumer receives as the result of interacting with the service provider. In the Nordic model, this result is expressed in the technical quality of the service, which can be assessed by the customer, like the technical dimensions of a product. But as services are produced in the interaction between the consumer and the service provider, technical quality alone cannot account for the quality as perceived by the customer. Customers are not only interested in the outcome of a service process, but they are also interested in how the service is provided, they are interested in the functional quality of the service.

Third quality dimension identified by Gr<f6>nroos is the image of the service provider, which moderates both technical and functional quality to arrive at a perceived level of service. The public image of the service provider appears on both sides of the total perceived quality equation as it is also considered to moderate expected quality. Gr<f6>nroos indicated that technical and functional quality are interrelated, but argued that functional quality was more important to the quality of the service, as perceived by customers than the other factors and that the performance of staff in direct contact with customers can compensate for lower technical quality.[note]Brogowicz et al., 1990.[/note]

<h2>Conceptual Model: SERVAQUA</h2>

Several performance measurement models for water services have been reported in the technical literature on water supply.[note]Berg, 2010; Cabrera, 2011.[/note] These methodologies are predominately focused on intrinsic quality of the water supply instead of service quality. These methods are centred around measuring the technical parameters of service delivery, thus focusing on the product-like aspects of water services from the perspective of the service provider. Due to their internal view, these methodologies are not likely to be effective in driving customer-focused behaviour by service providers.

The SERVQUAL methodology has been reviewed in the literature for use in water services, <span style=""background-color: #f5f6f5;"">but little research has been undertaken to confirm its applicability.</span>[note]Vloerbergh, I., Fife-Schaw, C., Kelay, T., Jonathan Chenoweth, Morrison, G., &amp; Lund<e9>hn, C. (2007). <em>Assessing consumer preferences for drinking water services. Methods for water utilities</em>. Techneau.[/note] The five-dimensional SERVQUAL model has been investigated for an energy retailer, a service that can be considered analogous to water. It was found that the initially proposed dimensionality of SERVQUAL is problematic as the five dimensions show a high degree of intercorrelation.[note]Babakus, E., &amp; Boller, G. W. (1992). An empirical assessment of the SERVQUAL scale. <em>Journal of Business Research</em>, 24(3), 253<96>268.[/note] This finding subsequently led to the development of a context-specific service quality model for reticulated water.[note]Babakus, 1993.[/note] This model comprised of a 15-item uni-dimensional service quality construct, consisting primarily of service attributes concerning employees of the organisation, i.e. the supplementary services.

Both the model provided by Babakus and the standard SERVQUAL methodology only account for the process aspects of water services and ignore the technical outcomes. These methods are heavily weighted towards the supplementary services, which have different characteristics to the core service, mainly due to the higher level of interaction between service provider and customer and the lower level of tangibility of supplementary services compared to core services. An alternative methodology is required to provide meaningful outcomes in service factories such as reticulated potable water services.

The distinction between technical quality and functional quality makes the Nordic model a suitable framework to develop a service quality framework in reticulated water. Technical quality constitutes the set of measurable physical parameters of the tangible aspects of the service, as perceived by the customer, i.e. the level of purity and pressure of the core services. Due to the lack of customer interaction in the provision of core services in water, it is reasonable to propose that functional quality in a water supply is wholly located in the supplementary services, e.g. billing, information provision and so on. To develop a salient model for service quality in water, a distinction needs to be drawn between core service (technical quality) and supplementary services (functional quality).

<h3>Technical Quality: Core Services</h3>

Tangible elements as water dominate the core service in reticulated water can be directly experienced by customers. Evaluation of the service is based on experience qualities because the customer can assess most aspects of the core service through visual, tactile, olfactory and gustatory verification. Each opening of a tap consists of two Moments of Truth: the pressure and purity of the water are assessed against the customer's expectations. The technical quality of the service can, however, not be thoroughly evaluated by customers as some aspects of purity of water are imperceptible, i.e. some impurities cannot be seen or tasted, although they do constitute a reduction in quality. These invisible qualities are credence qualities, and although the customer's senses can not directly verify these qualities of the water, they can be determined by the service provider.

Practical experience in the provision of water services reveals an inherent tension between technical quality and functional quality. Operators of drinking water systems are required to comply with local regulatory requirements. Meeting these requirements can, however, lead to a reduction in service quality. For example, adding chlorine is essential to ensure public health in that it destroys micro-organisms. In some communities, however, chlorine is perceived as an unwanted chemical, leading to a reduction in service quality.[note]Kot, M., Castleden, H., &amp; Gagnon, G. A. (2011). Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities: Examples from Atlantic Canada. <em>Health &amp; Place</em>, 17(5), 1030<96>1037. doi:<a title=""Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities: Examples from Atlantic Canada. Health &amp; Place"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.06.012"">10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.06.012</a>.[/note] This example shows that the quality of a service can be defined from two perspectives: that of the customer and that of the service provider. The customer assesses the experienced quality attributes concerning what is capable of being perceived. From the service provider's perspective, quality resides intrinsically within the service itself. The recognition of intrinsic quality does not negate the importance of the customer's perception, but relying on service quality alone fails to accommodate the importance of attributes intrinsic to the service in influencing service quality and value offered to the customer.[note]Walker, R. H., &amp; Johnson, L. W. (2009). Signalling intrinsic service quality and value via accreditation and certification. <em>Managing Service Quality</em>, 19(1), 85<96>105.[/note] A distinction can thus be made between extrinsic and intrinsic technical quality. Extrinsic technical quality is based on the perception of customers, while intrinsic technical quality is embedded within the service itself and includes credence qualities not directly observable to the customer. These considerations lead to the suggestion that technical quality needs to be determined from both perspectives to provide a complete view of service quality.

To measure intrinsic technical quality from a customer's perspective, the time-price for water can be used to conceptualise this aspect of the construct. Customers don't only pay for the service with their money, but also with their time. This concept is especially important in services as production and consumption co-occur.[note]Becker, G. S. (1965). A theory of the allocation of time. <em>The Economic Journal</em>, 75(299), 493<96>517; Davies, G., &amp; Omer, O. (1996). Time allocation and marketing. Time &amp; Society, 5(2), 253<96>268. doi:<a title=""Time allocation and marketing. Time &amp; Society"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0961463X96005002007"">10.1177/0961463X96005002007</a>.[/note]

The time-price of residential water consumption in developed markets is negligible due to the technological advancement in hydraulic and chemical engineering. This high level of service is a stark contrast with areas without reticulated water where a woman may spend hours every day obtaining their daily allocation of water.[note]Williams, R. F. G., &amp; Mountjoy, N. (2012). Seeing water in a spatial and temporal perspective: the residential demand for water in regional Victoria. Presented at the 41st <em>Conference of Economists</em>, Melbourne, Australia: School of Economics, La Trobe University, Bendigo, Australia.[/note] A time-price is, however, incurred when the core service does not meet the expectations of the customer, either water does not have the expected purity and cannot be used for its intended purpose or the pressure is either too low or too high or even zero. This thought leads to the idea that a water utility providing a perfect level of service is invisible to the consumer.[note]Prevos, P. (2012). <a title=""VicWater Conference (2012) Presentation"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/vicwater-conference-2012/"">The Invisible Water Corporation</a>. Presented at the VicWater Conference, Melbourne.[/note] A perfectly invisible water company delivers water whenever customers want it; customers never need to contact the service provider; bills are accurate, easy to understand and pay and so on. Customers pay additional time only in cases of service failures, in those instances where water is not available or needs to be boiled before it is suitable for human consumption due to treatment failures. Using this time-price concept and its relation to service failures, the intrinsic technical quality of the core service can be estimated by assessing the likelihood that a Moment of Truth is confirmed, i.e. the likelihood that expectations are met at each interaction with the service provider. Using methodologies developed for the Six Sigma improvement system,[note]George, M. L. (2003). <em>Lean Six Sigma for Service How to Use Lean Speed and Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions</em>. New York; London: McGraw-Hill.[/note] the level of service can be expressed in Defects per Million Opportunities (DPMO):

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex DPMO = \frac{disconfirmations \times 10^6}{2 \times moments \times population}$</p>

For example, a water utility serves a population of 100,000 people who each use their tap an estimated ten times per day. On average, a service failure occurs to 10 customers in the system where water is dirty or not available for a period of half a day. This can be expressed as 50 disconfirmations of service expectations regarding purity. The level of service for that day, expressed in DPMO equals 25:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex DPMO = \frac{50 \times 10^6}{2 \times 10 \times 100000}=25 &amp;s=2$</p>

This can also be expressed stochastically in that for 99.998% of all Moments of Truth in the core service, expectations were confirmed. To fully develop this measure, further technical modelling is required, which falls outside the context of this paper. Similar approaches to determine intrinsic technical quality can be developed for analogous service factories dominated by tangible elements.

The second perspective on technical quality are the extrinsic views of the technical quality of the customers themselves. Customers will, however, only be able to evaluate the experience qualities of the water through visual verification. Given the fact that the technical quality of the water supply also contains credence (intrinsic) qualities that cannot be assessed by customers, it is hypothesised that the intrinsic technical quality and extrinsic technical quality will not be the same.

<h3>Supplementary Services</h3>

The functional quality of water services is almost exclusively located in the provision of supplementary services, which are characterised by a high level of customer interaction with the service provider and a small degree of tangibility. The scale developed by Babakus (1993) illustrates the importance of supplementary serves in the development of service quality perceptions as almost all items identified in his model relate to organisational behaviour. The uni-dimensional model consists of fifteen elements, all of which mainly relate to the supplementary services:

<ol>
    <li>Billing accuracy</li>
    <li>Reliability of services</li>
    <li>Efficiency of services</li>
    <li>Customer service</li>
    <li>Safety consciousness</li>
    <li>Dependability</li>
    <li>Knowledge level of employees</li>
    <li>Providing services at the promised time</li>
    <li>Responsiveness</li>
    <li>Reassurance and understanding</li>
    <li>Having customers' interest at heart</li>
    <li>Willingness of employees to assist customers</li>
    <li>Quality of management</li>
    <li>Billing clarity</li>
    <li>Politeness of employees</li>
</ol>

In this list of scale items we can recognise several of the five dimensions of SERVQUAL, i.e. reliability (items 2 and 8), assurance (item 6), empathy (items 10<96>12 and 15) and responsiveness (item 3 and 9). There is, however, no mention of tangibility related items, which are all presumed to be located in the technical quality.

<h3>Summary</h3>

To measure service quality in reticulated water and similar services, such as energy provision, the Nordic model of service quality is preferred over the SERVQUAL methodology due to its ability to distinguish between technical quality and functional quality. Reticulated water being a service factory, dominated by tangible elements, the technical quality is located in the provision of the core service, while the functional quality is considered to be located in the supplementary services. The conceptual SERVAQUA model is defined as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Technical Quality (core services):
<ul>
    <li>Intrinsic: Likelihood of confirmation of expectations</li>
    <li>Extrinsic: Consumer perception of technical quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Functional quality (supplementary services): Uni-dimensional model identified by Babakus (1993).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

To test the face and content validity of SERVAQUA an exploratory qualitative study was undertaken to determine the antecedents of service quality in reticulated water services. Face validity is an intuitive form of judgement whether a scale measures what it is designed to measure.[note]Burns, A. C., &amp; Bush, R. F. (2010). <em>Marketing research</em>. Upper Saddle River, N.J.; London: Prentice Hall.[/note] Content validity is the degree to which elements of an assessment instrument are relevant to and representative of the defined construct.[note]Haynes, S. N., Richard, D. C., &amp; Kubany, E. S. (1995). Content validity in psychological assessment: A functional approach to concepts and methods. <em>Psychological Assessment</em>, 7(3), 238<96>247; Lee, N., &amp; Lings, I. (2008). <em>Doing business research: A guide to theory and practice</em>. London: SAGE.[/note] The concepts of face and content validity are sometimes used interchangeably, although not synonymous with construct validity, i.e. the degree to which an instrument measures the targeted construct.[note]Churchill, G. A. (1979). A paradigm for developing better measures of marketing constructs. <em>Journal of Marketing Research</em>, 60<96>64.[/note] Face validity can be interpreted as a precursor of construct validity and content validation provides evidence of the construct validity of an instrument.[note]Turner, S. P. (1979). The concept of face validity. <em>Quality and Quantity</em>, 13(1), 85<96>90; Haynes et al., 1995.[/note]

Case studies are widely used in organisational research. The use of case studies is, however, problematic from a methodological perspective as there are virtually no specific requirements guiding case research.[note]Meyer, C. B. (2001). A case study methodology. <em>Field Methods</em>, 13(4), 329<96>352. doi:<a title=""A case in case study methodology. Field Methods"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1525822X0101300402"">10.1177/1525822X0101300402</a>.[/note] The case study approach is a study in which a single case study or a small number of cases and information obtained from these cases is analysed in a qualitative manner.[note]Dul, J., &amp; Hak, T. (2008). <em>Case Study Methodology in Business Research</em>. Amsterdam; Boston: Elsevier/Butterworth-Heinemann/Elsevier.[/note] Case studies and other qualitative designs differ in that case studies are open to the use of theory or conceptual categories to guide the researcher.[note]Meyer, 2001[/note]

A qualitative methodology was employed by interviewing five organisations that represent customers of water utilities within the same market in Australia. Most respondents also represent customers of energy retailers. One interview was conducted with a former water utility customer service manager. The interviews followed a semi-structured approach and questions focused on the respondent's perception of what constitutes a good level of service from the customer's perspective. Interview questions were modelled around the provision of core and supplementary services.

The literature on case studies advises to include several cases for analysis to strengthen generalisability and external validity.[note]Eisenhardt, K. M. (1989). Building theories from case study research. <em>The Academy of Management Review</em>, 14(4), 532.[/note] In this particular study, only one reticulated water market was investigated. This reasonable assumption justifies the generalisability of this research that reticulated water services are highly uniform across markets in developed urban areas. Respondents to this study are involved with customers of all water utilities that operate in the market under consideration. The interviews can thus be considered equivalent to a multi-case analysis and the findings generalise to reticulated water services in general.

<h2>Data collection and analysis</h2>

Interviews were recorded and transcribed using outsourced transcription services. All transcripts were confirmed by the researcher and subsequently coded and analysed using the RQDA software package,[note]Huang, R. (2012). RQDA: R-based Qualitative Data Analysis. Retrieved from <a title=""R-based Qualitative Data Analysis"" href=""http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/"">http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/</a>[/note] which forms part of the R computing language, an Open Source environment for statistical computing.[note]R Core Team. (2012). R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. Vienna, Austria. Retrieved from <a title=""R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing"" href=""http://www.R-project.org/"">http://www.R-project.org/</a>[/note] Data was analysed using an apriori coding approach, with codes identified from the literature review.[note]Liamputtong, P., &amp; Eddy, D. (2005). Qualitative research methods (2nd ed.). Oxford University Press.[/note] The interviews were structured around the distinction between core services and enabling services and the impact of organisational behaviour on customers. The data was coded over three iterations. During the open coding stage, apriori codes were assigned to relevant chunks of text, revealing forty individual topics. In the second stage, axial coding of the data organised the identified codes into seven categories. Some codes were associated with multiple categories, other codes were merged, renamed or removed. The last interview was coded after all other interviews had been analysed. This last interview did not introduce any new codes, indicating that the data was saturated and that the case study provides a complete overview of the market under consideration.

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Core Service</h3>

Most respondents predominately interact with customers that had a negative experience with their services provider through either consumer advocacy, complaints handling or regulation. The provided information is therefore heavily skewed towards instances of service failure and recovery. Customers are, in the words of one respondent: <93>not ringing <85> to congratulate you, they just[ring when] the water <85> taste different[or] looks different<94>. From the respondents, it became apparent that the technical quality of the service is, due to the high level of technological investment in Australian water networks, not a major concern, as water utilities <93>don<92>t get many complaints about the core services of water<94>.

Customers of reticulated water have a low level of involvement and are generally <93>passive receivers of service<94>. Expectations are simple and customers <93>want very basic things<94>. Respondents succinctly expressed the expectations for core service delivery: <93>efficient delivery of water services to their homes at a potable quality at a fair and reasonable cost <85>[without] interruptions to their delivery<94> and <93>clean, safe drinking water that<92>s safe for people to drink and to use for other domestic purposes<94>. Customers are also concerned about non-technical aspects of water, and there is <93>increasingly an expectation about the aesthetic water quality<94>, both visual and in taste.

Although the level of involvement with the service is considered small, customers have high expectations of the reliability of the core service: <93>people remember that one hour when a slug of dirty water went through after a repair<94>. There is an expectation that service provision is seamless, <93>people expect the service to be there and have no concerns unless the service is not there<94> and customers only contact the service provider when <93>something unusual or different has occurred<94>.

<h3>Supplementary Services</h3>

The most common topic raised by stakeholders were related to billing: <93>accurate and reliable bills, that they be timely, that they be simple to read and understand<94>. Respondents reported the importance of individual service, especially in cases of service recovery related to billing. Service providers implementing best practice offer a broad range of payment options, including <93>incentive schemes to help[customers] stay on track<94>. This observation contrasts with the core service, where differentiation is almost impossible. The most sensitive issue raised was around managing customers who struggle to pay their bills and the importance of <93>the ways in which water companies deal with that<94>.

A critical issue identified by respondents was the ability of service staff to understand the needs of the individual customer when an issue arises. Service staff are required to <93>tease out what it is[customers] are concerned about<94> instead of indiscriminately following scripts. Problems occur when, for example, staff don't use the language of the customer as <93>terminology is often the problem<94>. Some organisations have <93>specialised complaint-handling teams<94> that are trained in dealing with sensitive issues, which is a dedicated competency. Due to the importance of human interaction in supplementary services, it was identified that <93>a culture of actually wanting to understand complaints, wanting to <85> find the cause and <85> prevent[future] complaints<94>.
The ability of utility employees to solve the issues raised by customers was perceived as important, and staff that provide the first contact to the service provider need to have <93>enough knowledge to be able to solve the problem<94>. The level of service provided, especially with regards to facilitating services, related to <93>how empowered their staff are<94>. Some water companies were able to provide a high level of service by initiating <93>specialised <85> hardship teams to deal with people who are struggling with affordability<94>.

The monopolistic nature of service provision was linked to a low level of customer focus as there is no <93>threat of losing customers<94> which can make service providers <93>pretty passive<94>. The monopoly situation was linked to organisational behaviour as it creates a <93>risk-averse industry<94>. Providing excellent service to customers was considered a <93>cultural issue<94> about <93>what water businesses think about their role <85> if they think their role is to <85> provide good quality services to customers <85> they are more likely to <85> listen to what they need and resolve a problem. If they see their business as an engineering business <85> then they<92>re less likely to take that approach.<94> A good service provider was considered to have a <93>culture of actually wanting to understand<94> customers.

Concerning supplementary services, respondents acknowledged the importance of customer communication. Good water companies were seen to be <93>publishing messages about the security of supplies<94> and <93>water efficiency advice<94>. Last salient aspect of the interviews was the importance of responsiveness in cases of service recovery: <93>people expect if there is leaks or anything, there<92>s a rapid response<94>.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

Based on the outcome of the interviews, the proposed model for service quality in reticulated water has passed the face validity test, and the proposed conceptual model is <em>prima facie</em> suitable for the measurement of service quality in core services for reticulated water. Respondents confirmed that core services play a lesser role in their interaction with water utilities due to the low involvement of customers with the service and the high technical development of water supply in Australia. The concept of using the rate of service failure and expressing a confirmed Moment of Truth stochastically as a service quality indicator was confirmed given the high importance placed by customers on a seamless service experience. The difference between extrinsic and intrinsic technical quality was also confirmed by respondents, given the high importance customers place on sensory qualities of the water over the intrinsic technical parameters.

With regards to supplementary services, the content validity of the proposed model was partially confirmed. Billing was the most common issue mentioned in the interviews, both accuracy and clarity (items 1 and 14). The problem of reliability of services (item 2), efficiency (item 3) and dependability (item 6) was mainly expressed with reference to the provision of core services. Customer service (item 4) was not directly mentioned by respondents, but given the generic nature of this item, it can be considered a composite of other aspects of the responses. Mention was made several times to the relationship between monopolistic service provider and a lack of customer focus. Respondents did not confirm the importance of safety conspicuousness (item 5). The knowledge level of employees (item 7), and in extension their empowerment to solve problems, was identified by respondents as an important determinant of service quality. The responsiveness of service providers (items 8 and 9) was seen as important in cases of service recovery. Another issue that was strongly represented in the responses was the importance of empathy from water utility employees, which relates to items 10<96>12 and 15 in the proposed model. The quality of the management of the service provider (item 13) was discussed in detail with respondents. Respondents repeatedly mentioned the fact that many water utilities are engineering focused organisations that occasionally loose sight of the customer perspective. One aspect mentioned several times by those interviewed, but not forming part of the model, is the importance of providing timely and accurate of information.

<h2>Conclusion and Further Research</h2>

Reticulated potable water is a service provided at arm's length, with a high level of tangibility. This distance between a service provider and customer implies that the ubiquitous SERVQUAL method has limited applicability in measuring service quality in reticulated potable water services due to its focus on intangible elements and customer-service provider interaction. An enhanced model, based on the Nordic model of service quality and a recognition of intrinsic quality, incorporating physical quality of core service provision, is proposed to measure total service quality in reticulated water.
The results of the interview mostly confirm the proposed model. The information provided by the respondents allows for further fine-tuning of the model and identify dimensions and moderating factors to develop further and operationalise the proposed construct. Further research is required to test the theoretical assumptions in this paper and further develop the SERVAQUA construct.

The separation of technical quality in an intrinsic and extrinsic component is intuitively correct and was confirmed by the interviewees. This relationship requires further investigation through quantitative research. The relationship between technical quality and functional quality within high tangibility services has not been explored in detail in existing literature. The central question to be answered is whether there is a correlation between technical and functional quality. In other words, if a service provider supplies a high level of technical quality, will this result in an enhanced level of service quality? Second consideration is the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic technical quality. The practice of reticulated water supply shows that these are not the same, due to the difference in experience and credence qualities. Quantitative research is required to investigate this issue further. These deliberations lead to the following null-hypotheses that need further research:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex H1_0: Q_{technical} = Q_{functional}&amp;s=1$</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex H2_0: Q_{intrinsic} = Q_{extrinsic}&amp;s=1$</p>

These hypotheses will need to be tested using quantitative research, including testing the model for construct validity."

Operators of drinking water systems comply with local regulations to meet this objective. Meeting these requirements can, however, lead to a reduction in the perception of quality by the consumer. For example, adding chlorine is essential to ensure public health in that it destroys micro-organisms, but in some communities chlorine is perceived as an unwanted chemical.[note]Kot, M., Castleden, H., &amp; Gagnon, G. A. (2011).

<a title=""Service Quality"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-perception/"">Service quality</a> is the overall assessment of quality by the customer. In reticulated water, it<a0>can be defined from two perspectives: that of the customer and that of the service provider. The customer extrinsically assesses the experienced quality attributes concerning what is capable of being perceived. From the service provider's perspective, quality resides intrinsically within the service itself. The service provider is interested in providing <em>safe water </em>by meeting the relevant regulations<97>the customer is interested in <em>good water</em> through a positive consumption experience.[note]The concept of the distinction between safe and good water is from Dr Dharma Dharmabalan.[/note]

<h2>Safe Water Versus Good Water</h2>

The intrinsic perspective of the water engineer is predictable and rational. Water safety can be expressed in e-Coli counts, electrical conductivity and other <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-quality-index/"">scientific parameters</a>. However, the extrinsic perspective of the consumer's individual perception is non-rational. This non-rationality does not imply that consumers are irrational. A non-rational perspective is one that includes emotional assessments that cannot be described in numbers. How users of water systems view their service (<em>good water</em>) only partially overlaps with how engineers and scientists see the service (<em>safe water</em>). Customers are interested in good water and take safe water for granted. This aspect of water quality is for marketers to assess.

In marketing jargon, good water is determined by <em>experience qualities</em> while safe water is determined by the <em>credence qualities</em> of water.<a0>Experience qualities are attributes such as taste, that can only be discerned after purchase or during consumption, and credence qualities are attributes which consumers find impossible to evaluate because they do not have the knowledge or skill to do so and because many aspects of safe water are not immediately perceivable.[note]Rushton, A. M., &amp; Carson, D. J. (1985). The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles. <i>European Journal of Marketing</i>, <i>19</i>(3), 19<96>40. <a title=""The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004784"">doi:10.1108/EUM0000000004748</a>.[/note] This idea implies that as customers cannot experience the safety aspects of water directly, trust is one of the most important parameters in the provision of water services.

To provide a complete picture of service quality in water, it is important not to focus only on the intrinsic scientific aspects of service provision. A complete measurement system will include the non-rational dimensions of human perception. Scientists and engineers responsible for water safety need to work together with marketers to provide a complete understanding of water quality.

Engineers are often wrapped in stereotypes, highly focused on the technical task at hand but lacking marketing skills. However, in its purest essence engineering and marketing complement each other. In the words of marketing professors Philip Kotler and Sidney Levy:[note]Kotler, P., &amp; Levy, S. J. (1969). <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11124224_Broadening_the_Concept_of_Marketing"">Broadening the concept of marketing</a>. <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, 33(January), 10<96>15.[/note]

<blockquote>Marketing is customer satisfaction engineering.</blockquote>

In the delivery of water services, the attitudes and actions of engineers towards customer service are important as this directly impacts on the experience of customers. Engineers are mainly employed in <91>back-stage<92> roles and determine how the core services are delivered to customers, with <91>front-stage<92> customer service staff managing support services, such as complaints handling and billing.

A water utility is in this respect much like an <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/customer-perception-of-water-utilities/"">amusement park</a>: invisible staff members make all the rides happen, while the staff that interact with customers enhance the experience. The biggest difference between an amusement park and a water utility is that most customers never meet their service provider in person.

The development of an effective interface between <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/business-essentials-for-utility-engineers/"">engineering</a> and customer functions within an organisation is considered vital for providing customers a high level of service. The importance of good relationships between customer service and engineering personnel is acknowledged in both marketing and engineering literature.

Several sources of the conflict between these two functions have been identified. Polarisation of behaviour through a tension between standardisation and customisation and stereotyping of personality traits of the two professional fields are often mentioned. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-for-engineers/"">Engineers and marketers</a> have different educational backgrounds and occupy different <91>thought-worlds<92>.

To test whether such differences between customer service and engineering employees exists in water utilities a pilot study was conducted with an Australian water utility. Employees were asked a series of questions about the relationship between engineering and service functions.

<h2>The Engineering-Marketing Interface</h2>

The results of this pilot into the Engineering-Marketing Interface study reveal a small, but statistically significant difference between the views of employees with engineering education and those without engineering education. Engineers viewed the potential for tension between customer service and engineering functions as lower than those without engineering qualification. This was found to be the case for all items in the survey, except for the statement that <93>all engineers should know something about customer service<94>, which found strong agreement among all respondents. In other words, engineers perceived the tension between customer service and engineering functions as less important than other employees did. This result was corroborated by another part of the survey which revealed engineers having a lower level of empathy with customers than other staff.
In <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1959.9/561679"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">subsequent work</a> into the Engineering-Marketing Interface, these findings will be related to the experiences of customers to investigate whether there is indeed a correlation between the attitudes of engineers and customer experience. To complete this research project we are looking for water utilities in the USA and the<a0>United Kingdom to participate in this project."

This morning it dawned on me that <a title=""Marketing Myopia in Tap Water Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-myopia/"">water utilities don't sell water</a>; they sell experiences.

Water is a service with a high level of tangibility. The consumer can see, feel, taste, hear, but hopefully not smell the water. Tap water is, what marketers call, high in <em>experience qualities</em>.[note]Rushton, A. M., &amp; Carson, D. J. (1985). The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles. <i>European Journal of Marketing</i>, <i>19</i>(3), 19<96>40. doi:<a title=""The marketing of services: Managing the intangibles"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004748"">10.1108/EUM0000000004748</a>.[/note] These are the aspects of a service that consumers experience while consuming the service. The value of water is, however, not located in the physical qualities of the water<97>the <a title=""The Value Proposition of Tap Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-value-proposition/"">value of water</a> is located in the need the for water, as expressed in these mock advertisements.

<h2>Tap Water Advertising</h2>

Marketing wisdom dictates that communication for services that are highly tangible, like water, should focus on the intangible aspects.[note]Shostack, G. L. (1982). How to design a service. <i>European Journal of Marketing</i>, <i>16</i>(1), 49<96>63. doi:<a title=""How to design a service"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004799"">10.1108/EUM0000000004799</a>.[/note] So instead of focusing on technology or emphasising on the physical qualities of the water, tell customers what intangible benefits they get from their tap water. Most discussions about water focus on its life-sustaining properties, but tap water is so much more. Using tap water is an essential part of modern life and is used to maintain the lifestyle we have come accustomed to.

Having a shower is a perfect place for generating inspiring ideas; water is an essential ingredient in virtually every single recipe; water performs<a0>a<a0>crucial role in some of the most intimate moments in our lives.

These ads are designed to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/communicating-waters-value/"">communicate the intangible dimensions of water</a> and show that using water is not about the water itself, but about the value that water adds to our life. Advertising is <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/logical-fallacies-in-advertising/"">not about convincing people with logical arguments</a> but about communicating the value proposition that the utility provides beyond <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-branding/"">plants, pumps and pipes</a>."
605,service-quality-in-essential-services,Service Quality in Essential Services: Smart Utilities 2013,"This presentation outlines a model to <a title=""SERVAQUA: Towards a service quality model in potable reticulated water services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">measure the level of service</a> in essential services, based on contemporary ideas in the field of services marketing. Presented at the Smart Utilities Australia/New Zealand 2013 conference on 26 November 2013.

In economic models for the pricing of essential services, cost to the consumer is restricted to monetary cost. The cost to a consumer should, however, be extended to include the time required to consume services.

Given the high level of development of utilities in Australia, the time spent obtaining essential services is negligible, except when service delivery is disrupted. This is, however, not the case for facilitating services, such as the recovery from service failures, billing and provision of information and so on. These services require time to consumer, which can lead to frustrations.

My research indicates that consumers have a <a title=""People don<92>t care much about tap water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-involvement/"">low level of involvement</a> with tap water services and therefore have a low willingness to pay, both in money and time. This has implications on how to measure service quality and how to engage with customers.

The <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">Invisible Water Utility</a> is a concept used to describe the highest possible level of service quality, i.e. minimising the amount of time consumer spent on consumer essential services. Bills are paid automatically, billing is accurate and easy to understand and every time a tap is turned or a switch is flicked, expectations are met and there is no need to contact the utility, or to undertake other time consuming activities.

This presentation is based on research conducted with customers and customer stakeholder groups in Victoria. Also <a title=""Sentiments towards Tap Water in 140 Characters"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-sentiment-analysis/"">sentiment analysis using Twitter</a> has been used to support the conclusions.

The methodology is innovative in the sense that it acknowledges the low level of involvement consumers have with essential services. This goes against the current drive to increase engagement with customers, which is based on theories for high involvement services.

This presentation provides an update of my on-going <a href=""http://hdl.handle.net/1959.9/561679"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">PhD research</a> project into the relationship between organisational culture and service quality in essential services.

Ever since the start of the space race in the 1960s, rocket engineering has been perceived as the most complex human activity. Rocket scientists became the ultimate symbol of human intelligence and the phrase <93>It is not rocket science<94> has been heard in offices around the English-speaking world.[note]Call, D. (2005). Knowledge management<97>not rocket science. <i>Journal of Knowledge Management</i>, <i>9</i>(2), 19<96>30. <a title=""Knowledge Management"" href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13673270510590191"" rel=""noopener"">doi:10.1108/13673270510590191</a>; Dentzer, S.

It's not rocket science.<i> The Safety &amp; Health Practitioner, 21</i>(8), 40<96>41.[/note]

Does this statement make sense? Is rocket science so much more complicated than management? I think that rocket science is grossly overrated and that the<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/not-rocket-science/""> science of management</a> is a lot more complicated than the science of building rockets.

The science of space exploration has been a lot more successful than the science of management. Robots <a title=""NASA"" href=""http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/"" rel=""noopener"">explore<a0>Mars</a>; one spaceship has <a title=""NASA"" href=""http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/"" rel=""noopener"">left the solar system</a>; people have <a title=""NASA"" href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/"" rel=""noopener"">walked on the moon</a>, and much more exciting exploration is yet to come. Management as a science has not achieved much compared to rocket science. There is, for example, no generally accepted <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/motivation/"">theory for motivation</a> or effective decision making.

Rocket science is an extension of physics, and therefore all processes are entirely predictable. The more research scientists do, the better they understand the physical processes, the more predictable technology becomes. Management is not a physical science but a social science. Human behaviour is not like a physical process that can be predicted with high accuracy. Individual behaviour is unpredictable and more controlled by emotion than by reason.

Some might argue that human behaviour is, in essence, a physical process. It is, however, so complicated that it becomes inherently unpredictable as we are unable to model human behaviour in physical terms. There are no computer programs to help managers deal with people; there are no simple rules to make correct decisions<97>a lot of management is based on unsubstantiated rules of thumb and intuition.

That leaves me to conclude that management is not rocket science, it is a lot more complicated."
4289,perception-of-water-quality,Perception is Reality: Customer Perception of Water Quality,"Managing water quality is dominated by chemistry. Customers' perception of water quality is, however, mostly a psychological dimension.

Water utilities spend a considerable amount of energy in ensuring that drinking water is safe to drink. Armies of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/business-essentials-for-utility-engineers/"">scientists and engineers</a> undertake sophisticated analysis to ensure that customers can safely enjoy their water.

In my research, I am collecting data from customers of water utilities in Australia and hopefully also from other countries. The question is related to customers' perception of the quality of the supply, including aesthetics and taste. The questionnaire also contains an item associated with the difficulty people have paid their regular water bills as an indicator of the level of financial hardship experienced by customers.

<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">The research</a> is not yet complete, but the data is showing an interesting trend. All quality variables strongly negatively correlated with the level of financial hardship experienced by customers. In other words, the higher the level of hardship, the lower the customer will evaluate the quality of the supply of the water. It might be argued that this is caused by people with lower incomes mainly living in areas with a lower level of quality. The correlation does, however, also hold for quality perceptions that are not location-specific, such as promptness of service requests.

Financial hardship was found to be a significant predictor of grades. It appears that the level of financial hardship experienced by customers is related to their perception of the physical parameters of the water. Further research is required to confirm this relationship.

<h2>Customer Perception of Water Quality and Taste</h2>

Taste experience has been researched in depth in perception psychology. One of my favourite pieces of work is a study that shows that the taste of water is influenced by the material of the cup it is consumed from.[note]Krishna, A., &amp; Morrin, M. (2008). Does touch affect the taste? The perceptual transfer of product container haptic cues. <em>Journal of Consumer Research</em>, 34(6), 807<96>818.[/note] This research emphasises a thought I expressed in a previous idea: safe water is a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition for good water.

Delivering water that meets every known technical specification and health regulation will not guarantee customer satisfaction. Supplying tap water can be viewed from a perspective of experiential marketing. This philosophy of marketing relies on perception psychology to inform how a service is provided."
670,customer-perception-of-water-utilities,Customer perception of water utilities | Smart Utilities 2013 Conference,"I have been asked to facilitate a roundtable discussion on customer perception of water utilities at the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-quality-in-essential-services/"">Smart Utilities 2013</a> Conference in Melbourne. These are some thoughts I gathered to help facilitating this discussion.

<h2>Water utilities don't need to be customer focused</h2>

Engineers and scientists in water companies often believe that the level of service quality experienced by customers is only governed by legislation and technical standards. They<a0> are subject matter experts and there is thus no need to ask the customer what they want. One engineer expressed this view succinctly on a <a title=""Do water utilities need to have customer focus?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-customer-focus/"">LinkedIn</a> forum (used with permission):

<blockquote>You have to deliver good quality services, but I don<92>t get the concept that the customer is best placed to decide what those services are. They know they need pressure and they know if they don<92>t have water out of their tap, but beyond that, they have only a small understanding of the what is required to run a safe and efficient water supply system.</blockquote>

Political correctness aside, are these professionals perhaps correct? Will customers be happy as long as clean water runs from their tap every single time they open the tap?

<h2>Water Utilities are like amusement parks</h2>

Water utilities are a low contact service provider with most services delivered at <91>arm's length<92> by technical staff. Water utilities are in some ways just like an amusement park: technical staff work in the background to ensure that the services can be delivered flawlessly while customer service teams meet face to face with customers. The actual service delivery occurs <91>backstage<92> with supplementary service done <91>front stage<92>. The relationship between the technical and customer service staff<97>the engineering-marketing nexus. is very important to make it work. <a title=""From Asset Performance to Customer Experience"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/asset-performance-customer-experience/"">Preliminary results</a> of my research shows that there are tension points between the two groups.

Another good reason to compare water utilities with amusement parks (<a title=""Wet 'n' Wild"" href=""http://wetnwild.com.au/"">Wet <91>n<92> Wild</a>) comes to mind) is that water utilities <a title=""Communicating the Value Proposition: Tap Water Advertising"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-advertising/"">don't sell products, they sell experiences</a>. The experience of bathing your child, growing an abundant garden, cooking a great meal goes far beyond water as a physical product in as much the experience of an amusement park is not about the technical specifications of the water.

<h2>The water quality paradox</h2>

Even though customers are provided with perfectly safe water that meets all requirements, this does <a title=""Safe Water versus Good Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/safe-water-versus-good-water/"">not guarantee satisfaction</a>. More formally, water quality is not a sufficient condition for customer satisfaction. For example, chlorine is added to water to make it safe, but many customers complain about the <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"">gustatory</a> properties of the water.

My own research shows that perception of water quality is influenced by the level of <a title=""Service Quality in Essential Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/customer-perception-of-water-utilities/"">financial hardship</a> they experience. This is in line with the <a title=""SERVAQUA: Towards a service quality model in potable reticulated water services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">Gr<f6>nroos model for service quality</a> which states that service quality is influenced by company image. Other research, for example shows that the taste of water is influenced by the material the cup it is consumed from. There are thus influences, outside of the chemical composition of tap water that influence customer experience.

<h2>Customers don't care much about tap water</h2>

Tap water services are provided in a natural monopoly and customers don't have any choice on service provider. In many publications water is considered to be a <a title=""People don<92>t care much about tap water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-involvement/"">low involvement service</a>. Involvement is a person's perceived relevance of a service based on inherent needs, values and interests. Following this definition, it should make tap water a high involvement product. Practical experience shows that customers don't care much about tap water, as long as it is available <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/demarketing-water/"">without restrictions</a>. My own research shows a clear distinction between the level of cognitive (rational) and affective (emotional) involvement.

<h2>Trust is the major currency in tap water services</h2>

Perceptions of quality in tap water are related to more than just the chemical parameters of the water itself. It is influenced by many confounding variables. Most importantly, customers want to be able to enjoy they service without having to spend to much time dealing with issues. As utilities are generally non-profit (or may be better non-loss) organisations, trust is the major currency to measure success."
3352,socratic-management,The Social Gadfly: The Benefits of Socratic Management,"When studying business, there is little time for critical reflection on what has you have learnt. Universities arm newly minted MBAs with <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/management-tools/"">management tools</a> such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, the BGC Matrix, Porter's Five Forces and other devices to solve business problems. Their acceptance as valid tools is, however, often not based on critical reflection or solid empirical research but on mythical stories of how they were used successfully in the past.

The study of business and most of writing about business is based on the <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_method"">case method</a>. In this system, students are presented with a business problem and placed in the shoes of the decision maker charged with solving the problem. This article briefly discusses what we can learn from ancient Greek philosophers and why we should practice Socratic management.

In the <a title=""Coursera"" href=""https://class.coursera.org/criticalmanagement-001/"">Critical Perspectives on Management</a> course, Rolf Strom-Olsen advocates an approach that deviates from the standard case methods and draws from the more critical humanities. He sees the life of the ancient Greek philosopher <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates"">Socrates</a> as a signpost for a different way to think about business.

<blockquote>Socrates: <93>I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance<94></blockquote>

<h2>The benefits of Socratic management</h2>

We know about Socrates from the vivid writings of Plato who was one of his followers. His books form the foundation of European philosophy and in fact, profoundly influenced Western civilisation as we know it. Socrates spent his time meeting people in the marketplace in Athens and questioned their opinions and cherished beliefs. Socrates was like an annoying toddler that keeps asking ""Why?"" to find the foundations of what we hold to be true. The Athenians themselves compared him with a gadfly, a fly that annoys horses and other livestock. A lifetime annoying people by questioning everything they know is, in the words of Rolf, not a way to <a title=""Dale Carnegie, How to Win Friends and Influence People"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People"">Win Friends and Influence People</a>. Socrates thus paid the highest price for his life as a social gadfly<97>he was convicted of drinking a cup of poisonous hemlock and died.

From my experience, it is clear that being the social gadfly in business can be a dangerous activity which could lead to career suicide. For me, following the Socratic path has helped me to be very successful in solving business problems. Only by daring to ask the hard questions and draw from disciplines outside business we can see perspectives on issues that a case method cannot provide.

The traditional case method of solving business problems looks backwards at past experiences. Using the analytical method from the humanities allows us to draw from entirely different perspectives and analyse issues in creative ways. Business is an applied social science, and it seems only reasonable that the methods of social science should be used to understand the problems of humans.

<blockquote>Socratic Management: philosophical deviance to improve performance.</blockquote>

The Lucid Manager is courageous and not afraid to be a social gadfly and practices Socratic management. The Lucid Manager stops asking ""Why?"" and goes beyond<a0><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys"" rel=""noopener"">The Five Whys</a> if needed. View your problem from all angles<97>including disciplines that are not traditionally used in business.

Following the path of Socrates will help you to develop those cherished innovative solutions."
3348,useless-knowledge,The Importance of Useless Knowledge for Managers,"Although managing a business, or even a small part thereof, is a complex task, the solutions for solving problems often seem deceivingly simple. Managers resolve even the most complex issues with a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/alternative-risk-matrix-template/"">two-by-two matrix</a> or simple lists of steps. Most management books simplify the complicated world of business by providing attractive solutions with a high level of perceived usefulness.

In that goal-directed behaviour, managers often lose purpose and forget about what their mission is. Within my industry, many professionals are obsessed with engineering and forget about the true <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/asset-performance-customer-experience/"">value of tap water</a>.

I draw inspiration from knowledge outside my profession as an engineer to gain new perspectives. My inspiration lies in learning 'useless' subjects such as philosophy, ancient Greek or anthropology. My degree in the humanities has enhanced my engineering and management qualifications, and it has resulted in many publications and conference presentations.

This article shows how managers can improve their work by obtaining useless knowledge. What might seem useless and without purpose at first, will in fact become a powerful tool to become a more creative professional.[note]This article is inspired by an article in Dutch newspaper <a title=""'We snakken naar nutteloosheid'"" href=""http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/6700/Wetenschap/article/detail/3570702/2014/01/02/We-snakken-naar-nutteloosheid.dhtml"">Trouw</a> by Jonah Kahn.[/note]

<h2>The Importance of Useless Knowledge</h2>

To become the best possible manager, you should invest time in acquiring <91>useless knowledge<92>. The type of knowledge that does not directly enhance the bottom line, but enlightens the individual.

British philosopher Bertrand Russell once beautifully expressed the importance of useless knowledge in an ode to the humble peach and apricot:[note]Bertrand Russell, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Praise_of_Idleness_and_Other_Essays"">In Praise of Idleness and Other Essays</a> (1935).[/note]

<blockquote>I have enjoyed peaches and apricots more since I have known that they were first cultivated in China in the early days of Han Dynasty; that Chinese hostages held by the great King Kaniska introduced them to India, whence they spread to Persia, reaching the Roman Empire in the first century of our era <85> All this makes the fruit taste much sweeter.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7464"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2014/01/peach.jpg"" alt=""Bertrand Russel was inspired by useless knowledge about peaches."" width=""2000"" height=""950"" /></blockquote>

To enlarge and sweeten the fruits of management, professionals need to embrace so-called useless knowledge. This knowledge is not the type of information you get from reading the trivialities on Twitter feeds or Facebook. The canon of useless knowledge is more profound and includes philosophy and its continuous questioning of everything, the lessons of history and appreciation of the arts<97>the humanities of the liberal arts.

The words ""useless knowledge"" is problematic because it is a contradiction. There is no such thing as useless knowledge. A more suitable term would be <em>indirect knowledge</em>. This the type of knowledge that solves problems by introducing new perspectives from outside the world of business. Wielded correctly, understanding the humanities will make you a better manager by providing new perspectives.

Managers often equate useful with being practical. There is, however, nothing more practical than a good theory. Besides doing something, managers also need to think. The humanities teach you how to think, how to take a new perspective, think about meaning and purpose, without falling into the platitudes of popular management books.

Knowing some basic philosophy of science helps managers to comprehend what 'evidence-based management' actually entails. Reading about ethical dilemmas and the solutions proposed by philosophers might prevent managers from making morally wrong decisions. Visiting an art gallery during lunch will reset your brain and provides new inspiration to solve your mundane work problems. Reading literature will help you to understand your customers better.

<h2>Steve Jobs and the Humanities</h2>

A well-grounded appreciation of the arts beyond economic value helps in creating beautiful products loved by your customers. A textbook example of an organisation that has integrated both business utilitarianism and the humanities is Apple. In one of his last public performances, <a title=""Steve Jobs on the liberal arts"" href=""http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/steve-jobs-technology-alone-is-not-enough"">Steve Jobs</a> said:

<blockquote>It's in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough <97> it's technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our heart sing.</blockquote>

Useless knowledge makes you question the certainties of life; it creates a thoughtful and reflective mind, protected against impulsive decision making. Knowledge of the humanities literally humanises technology because, as Jobs put it: ""technology alone is not enough"".

Managers should embrace useless knowledge and study the classics, and the understand the humanities. Read some of Plato's dialogues and learn from<a0><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/socratic-management/"">Socrates</a><a0>how <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">deviant behaviour leads to innovation</a>.

721,business-essentials-for-utility-engineers,Business Essentials for Utility Engineers: Marketing and engineering,"Surfing the web to find new material for literature review can sometimes reveal surprises. When looking for ""tap water marketing"" related references I found a book titled <a href=""https://amzn.to/2N5woOL"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><i>Business Essentials for Utility Engineers</i></a> by Richard Brown. I immediately proceeded to purchase a copy and am impressed with the comprehensive nature of the book, and I highly recommend it to all engineers working in the utility industry.

The author does, however, suffer from the type of <a title=""Marketing Myopia in Tap Water Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/marketing-myopia/"">marketing myopia</a> seen in utilities and most commonly in <a title=""Do water utilities need to have customer focus?"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-utility-customer-focus/"">engineers</a>. I am not against engineers, after all; I am one myself. In the preface Richard Brown writes (emphasis added):
<blockquote>This book does not address a variety of topics that are typically covered in a business curriculum. Examples include strategy,<em> marketing</em>, organizational design, human resources, and business ethics. These topics are important in a general sense, but tend to be peripheral to most issues facing utility engineers.</blockquote>
With this statement, Brown moves marketing to the periphery of utility engineering, while moving economics and accounting in the spotlight through his book. The content of the book does, however, tell a different story. It contains over five hundred mentions of customers <97> more than one per page on average. Although Brown believes he excluded marketing from his work, it is in fact a central element of the book.

4290,water-quality-index,Defining a Water Quality Index to Communicate System Performance,"Reporting water quality performance to senior management or customers can be problematic as it requires a myriad of numbers and trying to pronounce parameters<97>impossible words such as clostridium perfringens, polydiallyldimethylammonium or bromochloroacetonitrile are not part of the vocabulary of most people. These terms appear in the <a href=""https://nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-drinking-water-guidelines"">Australian Drinking Water Guidelines</a> (2011). Directors and customers of utilities are generally not water quality specialists and that need to be provided with easy to digest information for them to be able to assess how drinking water supply systems perform. A water quality index is currently in development to achieve this goal.

The index is aimed at reducing complex data matrices to a single number, combining information from various sources. The index provides an overview of water quality performance, without mentioning technical details. The overall index consists of five parameters: treatment effectiveness, network protection, regulatory compliance and customer perception.

Given the broad nature of these parameters<97>from subjective assessments by customers to objective laboratory data<97>a certain level of subjectivity is unavoidable. The different aspects of the index will not contribute equally to the overall performance of water supply: How should we view customer complaints about laboratory data?

<h2>Methodology</h2>

A crowd-sourcing tactic was employed in the form of a survey to seek the collective opinion of water quality experts. A total of 36 responses were received from Australia, New Zealand, the USA<a0>and Europe. The survey was closed on 31 January 2014.

Respondents were asked about their involvement in water quality (such as level of education and amount of experience in the field). The primary survey consisted of two question banks regarding the relative importance of each of the proposed index factors and network sub-factors. Data was analysed using the using statistical package <em>R</em>. Responses can be considered reliable as the average standard error is less than 5%. The complete survey results and detailed analysis can be viewed on <a title=""Easy web publishing from R"" href=""http://rpubs.com/pprevos/wqindex"">Rpubs</a>. The raw scores on the main questions are presented in the diagrams below. The levels on the Y-axis are the relative importance (0<96>100) given to each of the parameters by respondents.

<h2>Water Quality Index Analysis</h2>

The individual results regarding the relative importance of the different factors and sub-factors are self-explanatory. These survey results will weight the final index scores. Additionally, some meta-analysis has been undertaken to obtain insight into the complexities of assessing water quality performance. Factor analysis with varimax rotation revealed that a one-factor solution is capable of explaining 49% of the variance. This is an indication that questions were answered consistently among respondents and that item scores can be interpreted as originating from one <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable"">latent variable</a>, i.e. water quality performance.

Ten respondents also provided additional comments regarding the water quality index. Some respondents mentioned that the questions were <93>simplistic<94>, <93>ambiguous<93> and <93>inaccurate<94>. This problem is, however, inherent to the data reduction and simplicity objectives of the water quality index. The index's ambiguity and inaccuracy are a reflection of the fact that information is sourced from paradigmatically different sources such as customer feedback and laboratory results.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Due to the reduction in data complexity, the index, its factors and sub-factors cannot be used for quantitative analysis. The index is, in essence, a qualitative expression of water quality performance only suitable for communication and not for analysis.</p>

One respondent also commented on the relationship between physical and biological water quality parameters and customer's perception of these:

<blockquote>Focus on water safety sometimes gets clouded by issues associated with customer aesthetic opinion.</blockquote>

This statement is an expression of the <a title=""Safe Water versus Good Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/safe-water-versus-good-water/"">water quality paradox</a>. Even if the quality of the water meets regulations, customers might still not be satisfied. Providing safe water is a <a title=""Necessity and sufficiency"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency"">necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition</a> to achieve customer satisfaction.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The survey has been successful and will aid in completing a water quality index that reflects the relative importance of the different aspects of water quality. The comments made by water quality experts are a typical expression of the difference in thought worlds between <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/engineering-marketing-interface/"">scientists and customer service professionals</a> and aid in further developing a theoretical model for organisational culture in water utilities."
3407,positive-workplace-deviance,Positive Workplace Deviance vs the Governance Chastity Belt,"According to popular history, when European knights left for the holy land during the crusades, they fitted their wives with a <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chastity_belt"">chastity belt</a> to guarantee their fidelity. The devices were a crude method to enforce chaste behaviour because the Knights did not trust their wives while they were on their holy tour of duty. It is unlikely that chastity belts indeed prevented any lonely woman from expressing her natural urges. We can apply this concept also to management and the rise of governance.

<h2>Organisational Chastity Belt</h2>

The chastity belt is making a comeback<97>and not only with contemporary connoisseurs of <a title=""Adjustable Stainless Steel Chastity Belt"" href=""http://www.dhgate.com/product/bdsm-2013-newest-design-female-adjustable/159106062.html#s1-3-1|2511396453"">erotic bondage</a>. The Global Financial Crisis has driven an increased focus on governance in organisations. More <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/alternative-risk-matrix-template/"">risk management</a>, more red tape, more creativity stifling procedures<97>more paper chastity belts. These procedural chastity belts serve the same purpose as the medieval metal versions. Chastity belts are a tool that replaces trust with a forced power dynamic.

A lack of trust in the ability of people to make the right decisions on your behalf often leads to a perceived need for corporate chastity belts.

Procedural chastity belts, just like their physical counterparts, are not foolproof methods to ensure chaste behaviour in wives and managers. Employees will circumvent any device that replaces trust when the motivation and the reward for deviance outweigh the risks.

The key to unlocking the regulatory chastity belt is to look at your processes and start to unravel them. Procedures should <i>enable</i> people to achieve objectives. They should not be the final word on how employees do their job. The people that write these procedures are after-all not all-knowing gods of management.

<h2>Positive Workplace Deviance</h2>

Lucid managers allow for positive workplace deviance, and they enable the employees to make their judgement on how to best achieve goals, instead of<a0>using the bondage of red-tape.

<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/deviant-behaviour/"">Deviant behaviour</a> has a bad name for obvious reasons. We all know people who behave negatively in the workplace, even resorting to bullying or harassment. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">Positive workplace deviance</a> is not about embracing your Machiavellian tendencies but more about breaking unwritten rules to progress organisational objectives. To think outside the box, to use a cheesy metaphor, requires you to bend the rules to shift reality.

A popular meme to express this idea is ""<a href=""https://horizonofreason.com/not-giving-a-fuck/"" rel=""noopener"">not to give a fuck</a>"". This somewhat crude popular wisdom does not imply that you can rampage your way through your workplace with caring about the consequences. Positive workplace deviance is the subtle art of crafting your niche within your organisation or your industry.

A Lucid Manager always asks why unwritten business rules exist and seek inspiration in playing little thought experiments to test the boundaries of the traditions within an organisation. Those trying to use positive workplace deviance to can find inspiration from the great Frank Zappa who famously said:

<blockquote>""Without deviance from normality, there can be no progress.""</blockquote>"

When I explain my dissertation topic to other professionals and academics, it usually raises some question marks. Tap water is, after all, an undifferentiated essential service provided by monopolists. Water utility professionals don't understand my drive to research this area because they are focused on the technological aspects of tap water. Marketing scholars struggle with the concept because it is a monopolistic service<97>there is no need for customer retention. There are distinct differences between the way water professionals<97>mostly engineers like myself<97>and marketing scholars and practitioners view water utilities.

In marketing several frameworks exist to analyse organisations, with the <a title=""Wikipedia"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix"">marketing mix</a> (the famous 4 Ps) as the most well known.[note]Borden, Neil H., (1964).

<h2>The 7 Ps of the Water Utility Marketing Mix</h2>
The 7 Ps of the Water Utility Marketing Mix are, however, not about pipes and other technological means to provide service. The water utility marketing mix needs to describe the experiences of customers.

Marketers and engineers come from very different thought worlds. In my work, I aim to build a bridge<97>I am an engineer after all<97>between the physical sciences that dominate the decision-making processes in water utilities and marketing theories based upon the social sciences.

An example of how this difference is expressed is that water utility professionals often focus on the tangible aspects of the service, while marketers would look more broadly at the intangible aspects and make them tangible. Many water utilities show pumps, pipes and plants on their website. It would be much better, however, to communicate the intangible aspects of the service as it will increase your customers' perception of the value they receive from their water utility. These four images below were created to demonstrate this point of view.

800,weasel-words,Weasel Words in Water Utilities: Sanitising Public Language,"Weasel words are often used by demagogues, politicians and marketers to disguise what they are saying. A tax becomes a levy, we no longer live, we have a lifestyle and sacking people becomes downsizing. They are weasel words because they suck the meaning out of language, just like a weasel sucks eggs.[note]Don Watson, <a title=""Dictionary of Weasel Words website"" href=""http://www.weaselwords.com.au/home/"">Watson's Dictionary of Weasel Words</a>, Knopf, 2004.[/note] Some weasel words, or buzzwords, are so common that they appear on special <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/buzzword-bingo/"">bingo cards</a>.

This type of language is, unfortunately also familiar with water utilities. What used to be a sewage treatment plant is now a water reclamation facility, removing any reference to its origins. Sewerage Sludge is magically transformed to a 'biosolid', ensuring that the average person has no idea what its provenance is. These new terms suck all meaning from the original words.

<h2>Sanitising public language</h2>

In a recent article in <em>Water21</em>, the magazine for the International Water Association, John Baten proposed to take 'evolve' the language used by water professionals to even deeper levels of befuddlement, as evidenced by the table below.[note]Baten III, J. (2014). One Water: Uniting around a new water language. Water 21, (February), 12<96>16.[/note]

Some of these suggestions are even sucking the life out of the existing weasel words. To call a sewage treatment plant a 'renew enterprise' is confusing and deceptive. The regeneration<97>excuse me for using one of these terms<97>of treated effluent to Star-rated water is a total obfuscation of reality and removes water users even further away from the problems in our water supply chain.

Having said this, a careful choice of words is important. Empirical research demonstrated that framing 'treated wastewater' as 'recycled water' changed perceptions of the product by consumers and increased their willingness to use and to pay for the service.[note]Menegaki, A. N., Mellon, R. C., Vrentzou, A., Koumakis, G., &amp; Tsagarakis, K. P. (2009).

1731,water-utility-competition,Water Utility Competition: Lessons from the Electricity Sector,"Water utilities are considered to be natural monopolies. Economic theory holds that in industries where long-run average cost decline as output expands, a single producer will be able more efficient in delivering services than multiple providers. But are water utilities natural monopolies?

In this paper, we sketch a scenario for a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-privatisation/"">competitive landscape</a> in the urban water industry and provide some thoughts on how to respond strategically to the threat of new entrants in the municipal water market.

<h2>Water Utility Competition</h2>

Marketing guru Theodore Levitt prophetically wrote in 1960 about the problems currently facing electricity utilities: <93>Who says that the utilities have no competition? They may be natural monopolies now, but tomorrow they may be natural deaths.<94> Levitt sketches a future where <93>fuel cells, solar energy, and other power sources<94> threaten the sustainability of the centralised electricity distribution system. Half a century after these words were<a0>written, they are becoming a reality.

<blockquote>Who says that the utilities have no competition?</blockquote>

The electricity grid is being inverted and is moving from a centralised monolith to an active decentralised network driven by consumer demand for green energy self-sufficiency. The ongoing development of electricity generation and storage technology will drive this decentralisation even further.

A similar scenario is unfolding in the water industry. Competition does not originate in large-scale third party access but in fragmentation of service delivery assets over multiple service providers. Developers are interested in decentralised service provision, seeking independence from publicly owned infrastructure.

<blockquote>Reviewing the concept of public utility in more detail reveals it to be an absurd one</blockquote>

The usual response of utilities is to move into defensive mode. Water utilities place themselves in a different category than other service providers. Utilities point out the unique qualities of water as a life-sustaining product considered the most essential of all services. But reviewing the concept of <91>public utility<92> in more detail reveals it to be absurd. Every good is useful to the public, the fully commercialised food industry being a case-in-point. Water utilities cannot rely on a preference status within the gamut of service providers to mitigate the risk of competition.

How can water utilities respond to the entry of new service providers to the market? Three scenarios can be sketched. The least productive response is to keep our head in the sand and wait for the hype to blow over. The experiences in electricity show that this is not an acceptable proposition.

Secondly, water utilities could revert to their powers as water authorities and create a regulatory burden on developers that minimise the likelihood of these proposals coming to fruition. The current discourse in this area is focused on the risk of becoming the Provider of Last Resort. In<a0>this scenario, an independent, decentralised utility would no longer be able to meet its obligations, forcing publicly-owned utilities to inherit the assets and liabilities. This situation is indeed not theoretical. In Europe and much of the United States, this is precisely the mechanism of how large vertically integrated public utilities came into existence. This blocking of innovation is certainly not conducive to maximising the public good overall.

<blockquote>Don't fear becoming provider of last resort. Become the provider of first preference.</blockquote>

The most productive way to manage the risk of becoming the Provider of Last Resort is to ensure that we become the <em>Provider of First Preference</em>. Instead of focusing on their perceived special status as a service provider, utilities should focus on understanding why communities are seeking self-sufficiency. Can incumbent water utilities become more entrepreneurial and provide a suite of services that would make developers not see the need for taking risks in becoming a water utility themselves?

The electricity experience may be instructive. The three big power 'gentailers' in Australia are players in the renewable energy market but are not big enough to avoid competition, for example from the South-Australian wind. This case suggests water utilities should prepare for such a possible future by further developing contribution arrangements, as well as considering approaches to managing the risk of third party access, including insurance, options and guarantee arrangements.

983,tap-water-paradoxes,Dissolve the Three Tap Water Paradoxes or Manage Ambiguity?,"Through my review of tap water marketing, I have stumbled on three paradoxes: statements that apparently contradict themselves and yet might be correct. Most paradoxes can be resolved. Can we also dissolve the tap water paradoxes?

<h2>The Water-Diamond Paradox</h2>

The oldest known water paradox is the <a title=""The Price of Water in Ancient Literature"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/price-of-water/"">paradox of value</a>. Ancient Greek philosopher Plato wrote more than two millennia ago that water, which is the most essential of things, only commands a low price. This paradox was formalised by Adam Smith, the father of modern economics. Smith compared to water with diamonds and observed that although nothing is more useful than water and nothing more useless than diamonds, however, water is cheap and diamonds are expensive.[note]Levy, D. (1982). Diamonds, water, and Z goods: An account of the paradox of value. <i>History of Political Economy</i>, <i>14</i>(3), 312<96>322.[/note]

Is this a paradox? Economists will tell you that this is because Plato nor Smith knew about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_value"">marginal value</a>. The marketing solution is to point out the difference between value and price. The price we are willing to pay is related to the relative value we attach to the purchase. Water comes out of our tap, without effort and without having to think about it<97>it has a low level of involvement. People are, however, highly involved with diamonds. Owning a diamond provides social status, owning tap water doesn't. The reason water demand a low price is because as an essential product it does not give us social benefits. But, when water is sparse, this paradox dissolves completely. In the words of Benjamin Franklin<97>""When the well is dry, we know the worth of water"".

<h2>The Involvement Paradox</h2>

Consumer involvement is defined as <93>a person<92>s perceived relevance of the object based on inherent needs, values, and interests<94>. [note]Zaichkowsky, J. L. (1985). Measuring the involvement construct. <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>, 12(3), 341<96>352.[/note] The fact that water is essential to life suggests that consumers of tap water have a high level of involvement with the service. Contrary to this sensible intuition, practitioner experience and literature states that tap water is a low-involvement service.[note]Babakus, E. (1993). Measuring service quality in the public utilities. <em>Journal of Nonprofit &amp; Public Sector Marketing</em>, 1(1), 33<96>49; Watson, A., Viney, H., &amp; Schomaker, P. (2002). Consumer attitudes toward utility products: A consumer behaviour perspective. <em>Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning</em>, 20(7), 394<96>404.[/note]

<a title=""Resolving the Consumer Involvement Paradox in Tap Water Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">This paradox can be resolved</a> by looking at involvement from two different angles. Tap water as an essential product will logically attract a very high level of cognitive involvement because life in the developed world without it is unthinkable. However, as a non-branded, undifferentiated, monopolistic service, the level of affective involvement it attracts will be significantly lower.[note]Prevos, P. (2014). <91><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">We Care About Water, Even If You Don<92>t</a><92>: Water as a Low Involvement Service. Presented at the World Water Congress, Lisbon: International Water Association.[/note]

<h2>The Water Quality Paradox</h2>

Although in well-managed systems, the chances that somebody does not receive excellent service through their tap are minimal, consumer perception of these services is often not as good as engineers would hope for. The <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-quality-paradox/"">water quality paradox</a> holds that although water might be safe to drink, customers will not necessarily value it.

Operators of drinking water systems are required to comply with regulations. Meeting these legal requirements can, however, lead to a reduction in service quality. For example, adding chlorine is essential to ensure public health in that it destroys micro-organisms. In some communities, however, chlorine is perceived as an unwanted chemical, leading to a reduction in service quality.[note]Kot, M., Castleden, H., &amp; Gagnon, G. A. (2011). <a title=""Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities"" href=""http://archive.org/details/StudyOverview-UnintendedConsequencesOfRegulationOnRuralWaterOperators"">Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities</a>: Examples from Atlantic Canada. <i>Health &amp; Place</i>, <i>17</i>(5), 1030<96>1037. doi:10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.06.012.[/note]

This tension between <a title=""Safe Water versus Good Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/safe-water-versus-good-water/"">safe water and good water</a> is only a paradox when we believe that one or the other side view of water quality dominates the other. The sometimes contradictory views are both equally valid and cannot be resolved easily<97>just like light can be viewed as a wave and a particle at the same time, so are both safe water and good water equally valid views.

<h2>Tap Water Paradoxes</h2>

How are we to deal with these paradoxes, do we need to resolve them or do we need to learn to live with the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/managing-ambiguity/"">ambiguity</a>?"
1073,service-quality-for-water-utilities,Towards a Service Quality Model for Water Utilities,"Water utilities are natural monopolies and therefore operate in a highly regulated environment. One of the cornerstones of all regulatory frameworks is performance measurement. Most existing systems are, however, merely lists of performance measures. These measures are categorised, but there is no underlying theory on how these relate to each other. These existing systems also focus mainly on performance from the utility<92>s perspective, with limited focus on the customer's view of performance.

I am currently working on two different aspects of service quality in water utilities. For my employer, I have developed a <a title=""Water Quality Index: Communicating System Performance"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/water-quality-index/"">Water System Performance Index</a> to communicate performance to boards and senior management better. For my dissertation, I am looking at how customers view <a title=""SERVAQUA: Towards a service quality model in potable reticulated water services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">service quality of utilities</a>. These two projects started separately from each other until it dawned on me that they form part of the same broader view of service quality in utilities.

<h2>Towards a Service Quality Model for Water Utilities</h2>

The quality of a service can be viewed from two sides from the utility's and the customer's perspective. In marketing terms, this is called <em>intrinsic</em> an <em>extrinsic</em> quality.

These two perspectives apply to the two types of services offered by water utilities: core services and supplementary services. Core service relates to the physical provision of water, and supplementary services are all other activities that enable or enhance the core service, such as information provision and billing. The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic quality for core services also relates to the difference between<a title=""Safe Water versus Good Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/safe-water-versus-good-water/""> safe and good water</a> I wrote about earlier.

[caption id=""attachment_4120"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""731""]<img class=""wp-image-4120 size-large"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2014/10/ServiceQualityModel.jpg"" alt=""Water Utility Service Quality Model"" width=""731"" height=""695"" /> Water Utility Service Quality Model[/caption]

The model gives us four areas to measure quality: intrinsic and extrinsic technical quality and intrinsic and extrinsic functional quality.

<h3>Intrinsic Quality</h3>

Intrinsic quality in core services can be measured using the traditional methods in the monitoring of water systems. This<a0>distinction gives us a view of how the water system intrinsically operates. Water quality parameters, pressure data and supply continuity are the most common parameters. The intrinsic quality of supplementary services is measured using a range of customer service metrics, such as the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/call-centre-workforce-planning-erlang-c-in-r/"">percentage of calls answered</a> within a specified period.

<h3>Extrinsic Quality</h3>

In this service quality model, the perspective of the customer has equal weight to the perspective of the utility manager. The perspective of the customer usually comes to us via two channels, occasional surveys or complaints.

<h2>The Service Quality Model</h2>

This service quality model combines the views of the utility professional with the perspectives of the customers. Although they often seem incommensurable and even <a title=""Dissolving Three Tap Water Paradoxes"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">paradoxical</a>, service quality in utilities cannot be adequately described by focusing on only one of these perspectives.

This<a0>model is only a sketch of the system under development. I am currently collecting data to test some of the assumptions on which this model is based and aim to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"">publish the completed version</a> next year."
1131,communicating-waters-value,Communicating Water's Value by Melanie Goetz: Book Review,"The literature on managing water utilities is dominated by technical tomes on how to implement the latest engineering developments to improve services. <a title=""Business Essentials for Utility Engineers: Marketing and engineering"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/business-essentials-for-utility-engineers/"">Engineers</a> often see marketing as peripheral to their quest to provide a reliable and safe water supply. It is, therefore, a delight to read a book on how to improve services in water utilities using marketing techniques common in other industries.

<a href=""https://amzn.to/2tHE8hV"">Communicating Water's Value: Talking Points, Tips &amp; Strategies</a> by Melanie Goetz is based on a sound basis of years of experience, backed by the latest scientific findings in behavioural economics, neuromarketing and related disciplines. This book is by no means a nerdy academic treatise. The countless vividly written examples from Melanie's experience in working with utilities will appeal to water utility professionals and place the theory in context.

The book delves into the non-rational (a term I prefer above 'irrational') aspects of human psychology and explains how the latest marketing techniques from the competitive commercial world can be applied to enhance the value proposition of water utilities.

Marketing has earned itself a bad name for being deceptive and manipulative, which is one of the reasons it is not often practised in public services. Melanie's book shows, however, that good marketing can tap into the forces of psychology and be used for good instead of evil.

Melanie recognised in the book that her work is ""preaching to the choir"". This book should be read by engineers, economists, accountants and all other professions that are usually at a distance from the customer interface. As pointed out in the latter part of the book, innovation can only arise from positive deviance. Daring to be different and break the shackles of tradition will not be easy in an industry dominated by traditional thinking.

<h2>The Value of Water</h2>

Reading this book, I latched on to one little phrase: ""We do not sell water, we sell status<97>we sell a solution for thirst"".<a0> When a utility recognises that they do not sell water, but the benefits that water provides, they are on their way to maximise the value perception held by their customers. Thinking of water as merely the product they supply, instead of the benefits it provides is an example of marketing myopia, a form of short-sightedness that can only be fixed by using marketing glasses.

My version of this idea is: ""We don't sell water, we sell <a title=""Communicating the Value Proposition: Tap Water Advertising"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-advertising/"">experiences</a>"". We sell good ideas (in the shower), we sell initiate moments (having a bath with someone you love), we sell personal fulfilment (gardening) and so on. Status comes into play only with conspicuous purchases, such as a pool.

When looking at a water utility using marketing lenses we see the service as the customers perceive it. Not the way customers might consciously understand water, but subconsciously. In <em>Communicating Water's Value</em>, Melanie keeps reminding us of the psychological subtleties involved in managing the attitudes and behaviours of customers.

This book is a great read for every water utility professional that wants to practice some <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/positive-workplace-deviance/"">positive organisational deviance</a> and start to think differently and increase the value proposition of customers. Not by investing millions in new gadgets, but by levering human psychology."
1164,direct-potable-reuse,Cultural Differences in Promoting Direct Potable Reuse of Sewage,"Direct Potable Reuse is a hot topic in areas where alternative sources of water are becoming scarce. There is a lot of fear in the industry because customers are not likely to accept this solution readily, due to our learnt attitude towards faecal matter, also known as the <a title=""The Yuck Factor: The Psychology of Drinking Recycled Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/yuck-factor/"">Yuck Factor</a>.

<h2>Cultural Differences in Direct Potable Reuse</h2>

Water utilities have tried a wide range of strategies to convince communities to encourage drinking recycled water.<a0>The general advice is to educate customers about the process. One of the rules of social marketing is, however, that rational appeals to change attitudes are not very useful. Clear examples of this practice are the many anti-smoking or anti-speeding ads that use emotional appeals to modify the viewer's attitude towards smoking or speeding.

Some commentators recommend using euphemisms for recycled sewerage such as 'impaired water' instead of polluted water. Some of these are <a title=""Weasel words in water utilities: Sanitising public language"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/weasel-words/"">weasel words</a> and should not be used as people see through the ruse.

Singapore is one country which effectively implemented Direct Potable Reuse (DPR). However, comparisons with Singapore are not straightforward since due to cultural differences between this country and Anglo-Saxon countries. Salient differences in culture can be identified using the system defined by <a title=""Geert Hofstede"" href=""https://geerthofstede.com/landing-page/"">Geert Hofstede.</a>

<ul>
    <li><em>Power Distance</em>: the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally.</li>
    <li><em>Individualism</em>: the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members</li>
    <li><em>Masculinity: </em>the level of interdependence a society maintains among its members.</li>
    <li><em>Uncertainty Avoidance:</em> The extent to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to avoid these.</li>
    <li><em>Pragmatism:</em> the extent to which people attach more importance to the future, fostering pragmatic values towards rewards, including saving and capacity for adaptation.</li>
    <li><em>Indulgence:</em> the extent to which people try to control their desires and impulses.</li>
</ul>

The data shows that the cultural profile of Australia and the USA are very similar. There are, however, notable differences between the cultures of Singapore and Australia/USA that need to be taken into consideration when comparing Direct Potable Reuse acceptance in these countries.

The <em>Power Distance</em> level for Singapore is almost double that in the other countries. Power distance influences the acceptance of government initiatives, such as DPR. The higher the level of Power Distance, the more likely a proposal is accepted.

The level of <em>Individualism</em> in Singapore is much lower than in Western countries in general. A small degree of individualism would make acceptance of initiatives such as DPR easier to implement because of the perceived public benefits. In Western countries, the high level of individualism complicates social marketing due to a large number of segments that need to be targeted to obtain coverage over a whole population.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <em>Masculinity</em> dimension is almost the same in all three countries, which has thus no impact on differences in acceptance.</p>

The low level of <em>Uncertainty Avoidance</em> predicts that people in Singapore feel much less threatened by the novelty of DPR than in countries with a high level.

The high degree of pragmatism in Singaporean society points towards a future-oriented view of water resources that includes thrift and a sense of saving for the future. This dimension is much less in Australia and the USA.

Finally, the <em>Indulgence</em> dimension is not very different between the countries

This comparison shows that firstly, understanding the value system of the consumers in the service area is essential to be able to craft an effective campaign for the acceptance of Direct Potable Reuse. Secondly, it shows that we cannot use an example used in one location and transpose that approach to another location."
4291,water-utility-branding,Water Utility Branding: What is your Utility's Personality?,"In one of my <a title=""VicWater Conference (2012) Presentation"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/vicwater-conference-2012/"">earliest presentations</a> on water utility marketing, I was asked by a spectator how the invisibility principle relates to the issue of branding for water utilities. My initial answer was that branding is not critical as a perfect water utility is invisible to the customers <97> other than the physical services they provide and the occasional bill. In the past two years, I have revisited this view and developed a more subtle approach to this question.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-708 size-full"" src=""http://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2013/07/unforgettable-moments.jpg"" alt=""Water utility advertising"" width=""600"" height=""440"" />

<h2>Branding a Water Utility</h2>

The biggest problem with branding a water utility is that the average consumer only spends a few minutes in direct contact with utility staff. The number of touch points between the service<a0>provider and customer, beyond the bill and the physical server, are minimal.

A few years ago I lectured <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/first-law-of-consumer-behaviour/"">consumer behaviour</a> for masters students at La Trobe University. After teaching students about brand personality, I asked students to view a website of a water utility and report back on the brand personality of these utilities. One student asked: ""Where is the emotion?"". The site was filled with images of excavators laying pipe, treatment plants and even a diver swimming in sewage.

<blockquote>Where is the emotion?</blockquote>

Water utilities can improve brand personality by emphasising the intangible aspects of the value they provide, as illustrated in the first image on this page. Water utilities are not technology companies, but they<a0>deliver a substance that mediates emotional experiences, such as bathing your child.

<h2>Branding beyond the logo</h2>

[caption id=""attachment_1211"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""759""]<img class=""wp-image-1211 size-full"" src=""http://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2015/02/newzeal_mhc01.jpg"" alt=""Wellington sewer manhole - water utility branding"" width=""759"" height=""568"" /> Wellington sewer access chamber.[/caption]

A brand is so much more than a logo and extends into everything the utility does and communicates. An example of where branding meets core service delivery are the assets that are visible in public space. Engineers design most water utility assets with a utilitarian purpose. The design of these assets, beyond their functional use, influences the image that<a0>people have of the local utility. This idea does not mean that we need to slap a logo on assets visible in public space<a0><97> it requires a bit more thought.

The photograph shows a sewer access chamber in the city of Wellington. The manhole is an excellent example of utility branding as it provides a talking point in the street. There is no logo, but this cover goes beyond the typical dull lids. The artwork is created by a local Maori artist and has symbolic meaning.<a0>The design represents the water and sewage that flows above and below the land. The koru, the spiral shape, represents the people who live on the land and who need the water and sewage to flow.

<h2>Branding an Invisible Water Utility</h2>

The <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-corporation/"">invisibility principle</a> still holds but it needs to be enhanced through using the theory of brand personality. Water utilities work in the background to make sure society runs smooth, without needing to take the credit. They are like the chef or the stagehand that make a performance go smoothly, without being seen by the customers.

The core services of water utilities need to remain invisible. But this invisibility does not imply that water utilities have no brand. There is still a need to engage with the community to develop a relationship with customers. Rather than speaking to customers about core services, which is usually a convsersaion about service failures, utilities can build a positive brand by proactively engaging with communities."
1086,service-quality-perception,The Customer is Always Right: Service Quality Perception in Tap Water Services,"The concept that customer is always right is a controversial topic in service industries, including water utilities. There seems to be a <a title=""Dissolving Three Tap Water Paradoxes"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-paradoxes/"">paradox</a> between how water professionals perceive the quality of water service and the way customers see it. Providing <a title=""Safe Water versus Good Water"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/safe-water-versus-good-water/"">safe drinking water is not the same as providing good water.</a> For example, chlorine or fluoride are added to the water ensure to protect public health. In some communities, however, chlorine and fluoride are perceived as unwanted chemicals, leading to a reduction in the perception that customers have of the quality of service.[note]Kot, M., Castleden, H., &amp; Gagnon, G. A. (2011). Unintended consequences of regulating drinking water in rural Canadian communities: Examples from Atlantic Canada. <i>Health &amp; Place</i>, <i>17</i>(5), 1030<96>1037.[/note] The perceptions that customers have of tap water can be investigated by analysing the sentiment of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-sentiment-analysis/"">tweets about tap water</a>. This analysis shows that approximately 60% of tweets express a negative sentiment.

Customers of two Australian and three American water utilities were surveyed to investigate possible moderators of service quality in water services. The preliminary conclusion of this pilot study is that <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/perception-of-water-quality/"">service quality perception</a> is not only influenced by the quality of the service, but also by external factors such as financial hardship and service involvement. This research has potential implications to how service quality is reported and interpreted and how utilities relate to customers.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A sample of customers from two Australian water utilities reported their perceptions of tap water</li>
    <li>Customers with a higher level of financial hardship rated the level of service lower</li>
    <li>Customers with a higher level of involvement rated the level of service higher</li>
    <li>External factors influence service quality perception of water utility customers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

This paper reports on a pilot of a research project investigating the relationship between organisational behaviour and customer perception. A sample of customers from two water utilities in Australia completed a survey about their perceptions of tap water. Customers were asked their views on the following concepts:

<ul>
    <li>Involvement with tap water</li>
    <li>The frequency of contacting their water utility</li>
    <li>Level of experienced financial hardship</li>
    <li>Service quality perception
<ul>
    <li>The technical quality of the services provided by their water utility</li>
    <li>The functional quality of the services provided by their water utility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Involvement with tap water was measured using the <a title=""Resolving the Consumer Involvement Paradox in Tap Water Services"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"">Personal Inventory Index</a>. This ten-point scale is regularly used in marketing research to measure the level of involvement consumers have with products and services. Consumer involvement is a person<92>s perceived relevance of something based on their<a0>needs, values, and interests.[note]Zaichkowsky, J. L. (1994). The personal involvement inventory: Reduction, revision, and application to advertising. <i>Journal of Advertising</i>, <i>23</i>(4), 59.[/note]

The frequency of contacting the utility and the level of perceived hardship were determined with single items on a 1<96>7 Likert scale.

The level of technical service was assessed using five questions about the physical services, i.e. availability, pressure, taste, safety, visual appeal. The level of functional service was evaluated using a scale consisting of 13 items, such as billing accuracy, friendliness of staff, availability of information and so on.

<h2>Service Quality Perception in Tap Water Services</h2>

A total of 649 customers from six utilities in Australia and the United States completed the survey, with the standard error of responses at 0.9%. The distribution of replies is indicated along the diagonal of figure 1, correlations between variables are shown above the diagonal and scatter plots below the diagonal.

[caption id=""attachment_1225"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""800""]<img class=""wp-image-1225 size-full"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2015/02/correlations.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1: Service Quality Perception in Tap Water Services"" width=""800"" height=""600"" /> Figure 1: Correlations between customer constructs.[/caption]

Analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between some of the constructs. Service quality perception is influenced by financial hardship and positively influenced by involvement.

Most salient was a high negative correlation between the level of financial hardship and perceptions of functional quality $latex (r(649)=-0.16, p&lt;0.001)$ and technical quality $latex (r(649)=-0.19, p&lt;0.001)$.

The level of involvement revealed a positive correlation with functional quality $latex (r(649)=0.26, p&lt;0.01)$ and with technical quality $latex (r(649)=0.35, p&lt;0.01)$.

The data thus show that the more difficulty customers have with paying their bills, the lower their perceptions of the level of service provided by water utilities. The data also shows that customers with a high level of involvement in tap water rate the level of service provision higher than those with a low level of involvement.

The level of technical quality also shows a strong correlation between the degree of functional quality $latex (r(649)=0.35, p&lt;0.01)$. The reason for this healthy relationship is unknown and is most likely caused by confounding variables.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

The idea that service quality is moderated by factors outside of the direct control of the service provider is a well-known phenomenon in marketing theory. Research in food marketing shows that the taste of water can be influenced by the firmness of the cup it was consumed from.[note]Krishna, A., &amp; Morrin, M. (2008). Does touch affect taste? The perceptual transfer of product container haptic cues. <i>Journal of Consumer Research</i>, <i>34</i>(6), 807<96>818.[/note] This pilot study indicates that these types of effects may also exist in the provision of urban water services.

Although the physical quality of water services can be manipulated by improving operational effectiveness, the perception that customers hold on the level of service is moderated by many other factors. The level of hardship can be controlled through pricing controls and rebates, but the socio-economic circumstances of customers can only be managed through empathy with their individual circumstances. Customer engagement and communication can influence involvement with tap water. Involvement is important to water utilities as it has been found in other services to also be linked to a consumer<92>s willingness to pay for services.

This research into service quality perception is currently being extended to include further data from other water utilities to confirm the results of this pilot study.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The axiom that the customer is always right needs to be nuanced. The customer might not be right about the physical facts of water service. However, they are always right about their service quality perception. This research demonstrates that to provide a high level of service to customers, a focus on excellent engineering will not necessarily lead to increased customer satisfaction. A deep understanding of customers is required to influence the moderating that moderate their perceptions."
1511,balanced-centricity,Towards Balanced Centricity: Moving Beyond Customer Focus,"It is an undisputed truism that service providers need to be customer-centric to be successful. This kernel of wisdom is more and more finding its way into the discourse on water utility management. While this statement is indisputable in a competitive environment, its application to public services such as water utilities is not beyond doubt.

Some contemporary marketing scholars, such as<a0>Evert Gummesson, are reconsidering the primacy of customer centricity have introduced the concept of <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11747-007-0065-x"" rel=""noopener"">Balanced Centricity</a>. Total customer centricity is a limited foundation for service providers because full implementation risks the sustainability of the organisation.

<h2>Balanced Centricity</h2>

Services are not created in a dyadic (two-way) relationship between customers and service providers, but they are connected through a network of activities involving a range of diverse stakeholders. Each stakeholder within the network is a beneficiary of the actions of another stakeholder. Value is co-created between the service provider and the beneficiary.

Customers are not the end-point, but also maintain their part of the value chain. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/value-of-water/"">Water has no intrinsic value</a> in itself, and its <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-value-proposition/"">value proposition</a> is only realised when consumed. The value chain for water utilities thus extends far beyond the customer tap. Most customer taps are used by multiple people who use the water to achieve the 3Cs:<a0><em>Comfort</em>, <em>Cleanliness</em> and <em>Convenience</em>. It is, however, not the water that creates the value, it is the activities that people undertake with the water. The water utility is only a facilitator is value in a network of relationships.

As public service providers, many aspects of service provision are dominated by professional judgments, such as public health considerations, which cannot be considered the domain of consumer experience. Tap water is an undifferentiated service where natural monopoly provisions prevent utilities from providing individualised services. Customer centricity in public utilities is thus limited to those aspects that consumers are capable of influencing.

Balanced centricity is a situation where all beneficiaries in the value creation network have the right to the satisfaction of<a0>what customers need and want.<a0>Regulators are a principal beneficiary within the value creation network for utilities. Water utilities service them through information provision. The environment is also a significant beneficiary of water services, which in Australia is managed through environmental<a0>water allocations.

This<a0>brief discussion shows that being customer-centric is not the sole focus of public service organisations.<a0>Public service has inherent limitations on the extent to which consumer judgement can be incorporated in service design. Also, the value creation network perspective shows that the consumer is only one of the many beneficiaries of the value creation process.

This first problem is trivial, but it shows some of the different methods that R can deploy to solve the same problem. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-5/"">Euler Problem 5</a> also discusses divisors.

<h2>Euler Problem 1 Definition</h2>

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sum of all the multiples</a> of 3 or 5 below 1000.

<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>

The problem definition on the Project Euler website is not consistent: the title mentions multiples of 3 AND 5, while the description asks for multiples of 3 OR 5.

There are four ways to solve Euler Problem 1 in R:

<ol>
    <li>Loop through all numbers from 1 to 999 and test whether they are divisible by 3 or by 5 using the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Arithmetic.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">modulus function</a>.</li>
    <li>Doing the same, using <a href=""http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/vector/vector-arithmetics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Vector arithmetic</a>.</li>
    <li>Sum the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sequences</a> of the multiples of 3 and 5 and exclude duplicates (numbers divisible by 15).</li>
    <li>Analytical approach.</li>
</ol>

The three brute-force solutions are swift because of the low number of steps to find a solution. An analytical solution significantly reduces the processing time as it only requires one step.

The problem involves <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">arithmetic progressions</a>, which are sequences of numbers with a constant difference. The sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ... is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of three. The sum of an arithmetic progression, where $latexn$ is the number of elements and $late xa_1$ and $latex a_n&amp;s=2$ are the lowest and highest value, is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex n(a_1 + a_n)/2$</p>

The numbers divisible by $latex n=3$ can be expressed as:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex \mathrm{sum}_3(999)=3+6+ \ldots + 999 = 3(1+2+ \ldots + 333)$</p>

We can now calculate the sum of all divisors by combining the above progression with the formula for arithmetic progressions as expressed in the above code, where $latex m$ is the divisor and $latex n$ the extent of the sequence. $latex p$ is the highest number less than $latex n$, divisible by $latex m$. In the case of 5, this number is 995.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex p = n \lfloor (m/n) \rfloor$</p>

Substitution gives:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex \mathrm{sum}_m(n) = p (1+(p/m))/2$</p>

19,euler-problem-2,Euler Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers | Solutions in R,"Euler Problem 2 looks at Fibonacci numbers.

The seeds inside the sunflower grow in a spiral pattern and the number of spirals tends to be a Fibonacci number. This pattern is the most efficient way to pack the centre with as many seeds as possible.

Famous mathematician and father of computer science Alan Turing was fascinated by this problem until his death.

They collected sunflowers from citizen scientists from around the world and confirmed that for the majority of sunflowers, the number of spirals is a Fibonacci number. They did, however, also discover other patterns. Euler Problem 2 is a bit less poetic as it only asks to generate and sum even numbers.

30,euler-problem-4,Euler Problem 4: Largest Palindromic Product and Lychrel Numbers,"Euler Problem 4 takes us to the palindromic numbers, a number that is the same when reading it backwards. Almost all non-palindromic number can be converted to a palindromic number through the Lychrel process. The non-palindromic number is reversed, and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. For example, 56 + 65 = 121. As another example, 125 + 521 = 646, which is a palindromic number.

Any number that will never become a palindrome is called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number"" rel=""noopener"">Lychrel number</a>. The number 196 does not become a palindrome, even after hundreds of thousands of iterations. However, there is no proof that Lychrel numbers exist. If we write some code to undertake the Lychrel process, we would never be certain whether it eventually will stop, which is the infamous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"">halting problem</a>.

<h2>Euler Problem 4 Definition</h2>

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number"" rel=""noopener"">palindrome</a> made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 <d7> 99. Find the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=4"" rel=""noopener"">largest palindrome</a> made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

<h2>Solution</h2>

This code searches for palindromic numbers, starting at the highest values. The palindromes are tested by converting the number to a character string. When the first palindromic number is found, the loop is broken.

The <code>reverse</code> function reverses any number and the <code>palindrome</code> function tests if the reverse is the same as the original number.

This problem can also be solved arithmetically. When Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777<96>1855) when he was a child his teacher challenged his students to add all numbers from 1 to 100. All of his friends struggled to add all the 100 numbers one by one but Carl completed the task in a few seconds.

The solution shown above is like Carl's classmates who slavishly add all numbers using brute force. Gauss' solution only requires one simple step. Computer scientists use Big O notation to describe the steps it takes to complete an algorithm.

In <a href=""https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Big-O Notation </a>the first solution is $latex O(n)$ which means that the number of steps in the algorithm grows in direct proportion to the data set. In this case, we only look at 100 numbers. But solving this problem for many billions of numbers would pose some practical problems. Gauss' solution is $latex O(1)$, which means that the solution only requires one step, regardless of the size of the data set.

Gauss found that the sum of natural numbers can be expressed as:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex n(n + 1)/2$</p>

The sum of the squares of the first $latex n &amp;s=2$ natural numbers is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$</p>

With these two formulas, a fast solution without having to use loops can be written.

<h2>Trumpworld Analysis</h2>

This article analyses the connections between organisations using the mighty <a href=""http://igraph.org/r/"">igraph package</a>.The package implements social network analysis for the R language which can be used for many purposes, such as analysing <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/analyse-enron-corpus/"">email traffic</a> or <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/pacific-island-hopping/"">flight paths</a>.

The code snippet below reads the data and converts it to a graph that can be examined using social network analysis techniques. I have saved the raw data available on Google Sheets file as CSV files. This data is filtered to contain only ownership relationships and the names of the organisations.

<h2>Network Analysis</h2>

This network contains 309 ownership relationships between 322 distinct organisations. When we plot the data, we see that most connections are dyadic connections between two firms. The plot is organised with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing"">Fruchterman-Reingold</a> algorithm to improve its clarity. We can also see a large cluster in the centre. The names have been removed for clarity. Our excursion into Trumpland continues by zooming in on the subnetwork. The second code section excises this connected subnetwork so we can analyse it in more detail.

<h2>Digging Deeper</h2>

The node with the highest <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)"">degree</a><a0>identifies the business with the most holdings. This analysis shows that DJT Holdings LLC owns 33 other organisations. These organisations hold other organisations. We can now use the cluster function to investigate this subnetwork using the decompose function, which splits the network into its unconnected subnetworks. The code then selects and visualises the largest of the subnetworks.

This Trumpworld analysis shows that the ownership network<a0>is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)"">star network</a>. DJT Holdings LLC centrally controls all organisations. Perhaps this graph visualises the management style of the soon to be president Trump. Trump centrally controls his empire, which is typical of a<a0>family business. Does this chart visualise<a0>Trump's leadership style? Is the star network an expression of his lack of trust and thus desire to oversee everything directly?

108,euler-problem-9,Euler Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triple,"Euler Problem 9 is about the ancient problem or Pythagorean triples. My background is in carpentry and the basic Pythagorean triple 3:4:5 is a common tool to check whether an angle is straight.

253,spike-detection,Spike Detection in Water Treatment Data in the R Language,"Spike detection in time series is an essential aspect of water treatment plant control. Spikes in SCADA data are events in the data stream of water treatment plants<a0>or similar installations. These spikes can indicate problems with the process and could result in an<a0>increased risk to public health. The <a href=""https://www.wsaa.asn.au/publication/health-based-targets-manual"">WSAA Health Based Targets Manual </a>specifies a series of decision rules to assess the performance of filtration processes. For example, this rule assesses the performance of conventional filtration:

<blockquote>""Individual filter turbidity ? 0.2 NTU for 95% of month and not &gt; 0.5 NTU for ? 15 consecutive minutes.""</blockquote>

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Turbidity</a> is a measure for the cloudiness of a fluid because of large numbers of individual particles otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Turbidity is an important parameter in water treatment because a high level of cloudiness strongly correlates with the presence of microbes. This article shows how to implement this specific<a0>decision rule using the R language.

<h2>Simulation</h2>

To create a minimum working example, I first create a simulated SCADA feed for turbidity. The<a0><em>turbidity</em> data frame contains 24 hours of data. The<a0><a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/seq.POSIXt.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>seq.POSIXt</em></a> function creates 24 hours of timestamps at a one-minute spacing. In addition, the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Normal.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><em>rnorm</em></a><a0>function creates 1440 turbidity<a0>readings with an average of 0.1 NTU and a standard deviation of 0.01 NTU. The image below visualises the simulated data. The next step is to assess this data in accordance with the decision rule.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Simulate turbidity"">set.seed(1234)
turbidity &lt;- data.frame(DateTime = seq.POSIXt(as.POSIXct(""2017-01-01 00:00:00""),
                        by = ""min"", length.out = 24 * 60),
                        Turbidity = rnorm(n = 24*60, mean = 0.1, sd = 0.01)
)</pre>

The second section simulates five spikes in the data. The first line picks a random start time for the spike. The<a0>second line in the for-loop picks a duration between 10 and 30 minutes. In addition, the third line simulates the value of the spike. The mean value of the spike is determined by the <a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Binomial.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rbinom</a><a0>function to create either a low or a high spike. The remainder of the spike simulation inserts the new data into the turbidity data frame.

    time &lt;- sample(turbidity$DateTime, 1)

    start &lt;- which(turbidity$DateTime == time)
    turbidity$Turbidity[start:(start+duration - 1)] &lt;- rnorm(duration, value, value/10)

The image below visualises the simulated data using the mighty<a0><a href=""https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ggplot2</a>. Only four spikes are visible because two of them overlap. The next step is to assess this data in accordance with the decision rule.

<h2>SCADA Spike Detection</h2>

The following code searches for all spikes over 0.50 NTU using the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/rle.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">run length<a0>function</a>. This function transforms a vector into a vector of values and lengths. For example,<a0>the run length of the vector <code>c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 6)</code> is:

<ul>
    <li>lengths: int [1:5] 2 3 4 2 1</li>
    <li>values : num [1:5] 1 2 3 5 6</li>
</ul>

The value 1 has a length of 1, the value 2 has a length of 3 and so on. The spike detection<a0>code creates the run length for turbidity levels greater than 0.5, which results in a boolean vector. The<a0><a href=""http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/cumsum.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cumsum</a><a0>function calculates the starting point of each spike which allows us to calculate their duration.

The code results in a data frame with all spikes higher than 0.50 NTU and longer than 15 minutes. The spike that occurred at<a0>11:29 was higher than 0.50 NTU and lasted for 24 minutes. The other three spikes are either lower than 0.50 NTU. The first high spike lasted less than 15 minutes.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Spike detection"">spike.detect &lt;- function(DateTime, Value, Height, Duration) {
    runlength &lt;- rle(Value &gt; Height)
    spikes &lt;- data.frame(Spike = runlength$values,
    times &lt;- cumsum(runlength$lengths))
    spikes$Times &lt;- DateTime[spikes$times]
    spikes$Event &lt;- c(0,spikes$Times[-1] - spikes$Times[-nrow(spikes)])
    spikes &lt;- subset(spikes, Spike == TRUE &amp;amp; Event &gt; Duration)
    return(spikes)

The Victorian regulators <a href=""https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/Api/downloadmedia/%7BA1F6D255-D5C7-4B7E-AAE5-8B7451EDE81A%7D"">also<a0>specify<a0></a>that the percentile should be calculated with the<a0><em>Weibull Method</em>.<a0>This requirement raises two questions: What is the Weibull method? How do you implement this requirement in R?

The term Weibull Method is a bit confusing as this is not a name used by statisticians. In Hyndman &amp; Fan (1996), this method has the less poetic name $latex \hat{Q}_8(p)$. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waloddi_Weibull"">Waloddi Weibull</a>, a Swedish engineer famous for his distribution, was one of the first to describe this method. Only the regulator in Victoria uses that name, which is based on <a href=""http://amzn.to/2k8shr8"">McBride (2005)</a>. This theoretical interlude aside, how can we practically apply this to water quality data? In case you are interested in how the Weibull method works, the <code>weibull.quantile</code> function<a0>shown below calculates a quantile<a0><em>p</em> for a vector<a0><em>x</em> using this method. This function gives the same result as <code>quantile(x, p, type = 6)</code>.

<pre>weibull.quantile &lt;- function(x, p) {
    # Order Samples from large to small
    x &lt;- x[order(x, decreasing = FALSE)]
    # Determine ranking of percentile according to Weibull (1939)
    r &lt;- p * (length(x) + 1)
    # Linear interpolation
    rfrac &lt;- (r - floor(r))
    return((1 - rfrac) * x[floor(r)] + rfrac * x[floor(r) + 1])
}
</pre>

<h2>Turbidity Data Example</h2>

Turbidity data is not normally distributed as it is always larger than zero.<a0>In this example, the turbidity results for the year 2016 for the water system in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnagulla"">Tarnagulla </a>are used to illustrate the percentile calculations. The range of weekly turbidity measurements is between 0.,05 NTU and 0.8 NTU, well below the aesthetic limits.

When we calculate the percentiles for all nine methods available in the base-R function we see that the so-called Weibull method generally provides the most conservative result.

<h2>Euler Problem 12 Definition</h2>

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $latex 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be: $latex 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \ldots$ Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

<strong>1</strong>: 1

<strong>3</strong>: 1, 3

<strong>6</strong>: 1, 2, 3, 6

<strong>10</strong>: 1, 2, 5, 10

<strong>15</strong>: 1, 3, 5, 15

<strong>21</strong>: 1, 3, 7 ,21

<strong>28</strong>: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors. What is the value of <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=12"" rel=""noopener"">the first triangle number</a> to have over five hundred divisors?

<h2>Solution</h2>

In the video below, Vishal Kataria explains a simple method to determine the number of divisors using prime factorization. The<a0>prime factorization of $latex n$ is given by:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex n = p^{\alpha_1}_1 \times p^{\alpha_2}_2 \times p^{\alpha_k}_k$</p>

The number of proper divisors is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex d = (\alpha_1 + 1)<a0>(\alpha_2 + 1) \ldots (\alpha_k + 1)$</p>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXRHfgqE1qY

The code reuses the prime factorisation function developed for <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-3/"">Euler Problem 3</a>. This function results in a vector of all prime factors, e.g. the prime factors of 28 are 2, 2 and 7.

The code to solve this problem determines the values for alpha using the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/rle.html"" rel=""noopener"">run length function</a>. This function counts the number of times each element in a sequence is repeated. The outcome of this function is a vector of the values and the number of times each is repeated. The prime factors of 28 are 2 and 7, and their run lengths are<a0>2 and 1. The number of divisors can now be determined.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex 28 = 2^2 \times 7^1$</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex d = (2+1)(1+1) = 6$</p>

The code to solve Euler Problem 12 is shown below. The loop continues until it finds a triangular number with 500 divisors.<a0>The first two lines increment the index and create the next triangular number. The third line in the loop<a0>determines the<a0>number of times each factor is repeated (the run lengths). The last line calculates the number of divisors using the formula mentioned above.

When asking R to compute this value we get<a0>1.844674e+19, losing most of the digits and limiting the accuracy of the results. Computers solve this problem using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Arbitrary-precision Arithmetic</a>. There are many software libraries that can process long integers without loosing accuracy.<a0>Euler Problem 13 requires this type of approach.

<h2>Euler Problem 13 Definition</h2>

Work out the first ten digits of the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=13"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sum</a> of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

<h2>Solution</h2>

The easy way to solve this problem is to use the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gmp package</a> for working with very large integers. This package uses a special number<a0>types such as Big Rational and Big Integer. The number of digits in these number types is only limited by the size of the memory.

<h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">Using Base-R</h1>

To find the solution to this problem using only base R, I wrote a function to add numbers using strings instead of integers. The function adds leading zeros to the smallest number to make them both the same length. The function then proceeds to add numbers in the same way we were taught in primary school. This function can in principle be used for several other Euler Problems using large integers.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Add numbers with many digits"">big.add &lt;- function(a, b) {
    # Add leading zeros to smallest numer

        b &lt;- paste0(paste(rep(0, nchar(a) - nchar(b)), collapse = """"), b)
    solution &lt;- vector()
    remainder &lt;- 0
    for (i in nchar(b):1) {

            remainder &lt;- 0
        }
    }
return(paste(rev(solution), collapse = """"))
}</pre>

With this function, the problem is easy to solve. The second part of the code runs this function over the one hundred numbers provided on the Euler Problem page and calculates the answer.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Euler problem 13"">numbers &lt;- readLines(""Euler/p013_numbers.txt"")
for (i in numbers) {

}

<h2>Multiplying Big Numbers</h2>

You can expand this function to multiply a very large number with a smaller number using the Reduce function. This function adds the number a to itself, using the <code>big.add</code> function. The outcome of the addition is used in the next iteration<a0>until it has been repeated <em>b</em> times. The number b in this function needs to be a 'low' number because it uses a vector of the length b.

<pre>big.mult &lt;- function(a, b) {
    Reduce(big.add, rep(a, as.numeric(b)))
}
</pre>

This video introduces the<a0>problem much better than I can describe it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mFpVDpKX70

<h2>Euler Problem 14 Definition</h2>

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

$latex n \rightarrow n/2 $ ( $latex n $ is even)
$latex n \rightarrow 3n + 1 $ ( $latex n $ is odd)

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

$latex 13 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 $

This sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains ten terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1. <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=14"">Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</a> Note: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

You can view the code below or download the most recent version from <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/ProjectEuler/problem014.R"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

<h2>Euler Problem 14 Solution</h2>

This problem is highly computationally intensive, and it highlights R's lack of speed. Generating one million Collatz sequences and finding the longest one requires a lot more than a minute of processing time allowed for in Project Euler.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Euler Problem 14"">collatz.chain &lt;- function(n) {
    chain &lt;- vector()

            n &lt;- n / 2
        else
        n &lt;- 3 * n + 1
        chain[i] &lt;- n
        i &lt;- i + 1
    }
    return(chain)
}

        answer &lt;- n
        collatz.max &lt;- collatz.length
    }
}
print(answer)</pre>

The second version of the code is optimised because it stores<a0>the length of all sequences in an array. When the code generates a sequence and lands on a number already analysed, then it adds that previous number to the current one and moves on to the next step. This approach requires more memory but saves a lot of computation time.<a0>A minor tweak to the code optimises the rule for uneven numbers. Tripling an uneven number and adding one will always result in an even number so we can skip one step. This solution is more than twice as fast as the first version.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Optimised"">collatz.length &lt;- vector(length = 1E6)

            count &lt;- count + 1
        }
        else {

            count &lt;- count + 2
        }
    }
    count &lt;- count + collatz.length[x]
    collatz.length[n] &lt;- count
}

<h2>Visualising Collatz Sequences</h2>

The Collatz sequence is an example of a simple mathematical rule that can create an unpredictable pattern. The number of steps required to reach one is listed in <a href=""https://oeis.org/A006577"" rel=""noopener"">A006577</a> of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. The image below visualises the number of steps for the first 1000 positive numbers. The scatterplot shows some unusual patterns. Does this visualisation show that the Collatz Sequence does have a pattern after all?

<h2>Collatz Chains</h2>

The Collatz sequences can also be visualised using networks. Each step between two numbers is an edge and the numbers are the vertices. For<a0>example, the network for the Collatz sequence for number 10 is<a0>5<96>16, 16<96>8, 8<96>4, 4<96>2, 2<96>1. When generating subsequent sequences the network will start to overlap and a tree of sequences appears. The tree below combines the Collatz<a0>sequences for the numbers 2 to 26. Number 27 has a very long sequence, making the tree much harder to read.

Like any other bored traveller, I thumb through the airline magazines and look at the <a href=""http://www.airlineroutemaps.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">air travel route maps</a>. These maps are beautifully stylised depictions of the world with gently curved lines between the many destinations serviced by the airline. I always wanted such a map for my own travel adventures. In this article I explain how to create a map of your own travels in the style of the Emirates Airlines route map.

<h2>Create Air Travel Route Maps using ggplot2</h2>

The first step was to create a list of all the places I have flown between at least once. Paging through my travel photos and diaries, I managed to create a pretty complete list. The structure of this document is simply a list of all <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Geography/flights.csv"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">routes</a> (From, To) and every flight only gets counted once. The next step finds the spatial coordinates for each airport by searching Google Maps using the geocode function from the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ggmap</a> package. You will need a Google API to enable the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/geocoding-with-ggmap/"">geocoding function</a>.

In some instances, I had to add the country name to avoid confusion between places. To prevent errors from the Google maps API, I have added a while loop that runs until all destinations have been geocoded.

We now we have a data frame of airports with their coordinates and can create air travel route maps. The data frames are merged so that we can create air travel route maps using the <a href=""http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_segment.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">curve geom</a>. The <a href=""http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/borders.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">borders</a> function of ggplot2 creates the map data. The <a href=""https://github.com/slowkow/ggrepel/blob/master/vignettes/ggrepel.md"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ggrepel</a> package helps to prevent overplotting of text. This code also removes any return flights and splits flights that crossed the date line.

The fifteenth Euler problem asks to determine the number of <a href=""http://www.intmath.com/blog/mathematics/taxicab-geometry-4941"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">possible routes a taxi can take</a> in a city of a certain size. This problem is logically similar to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-18-67-maximum-path-sum/"">Euler Problem 18 and 67</a>.

<h2>Euler Problem 15 Definition</h2>

Starting in the top left corner of a 2<d7>2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=15"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">How many possible<a0>routes</a> are there through a 20<d7>20 grid?<img class=""aligncenter size-full"" src=""https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p015.gif"" alt=""Euler Problem 15: Lattice Paths"" width=""208"" height=""151"" />

<h2>Solution</h2>

The defined lattice is one larger than the number of squares. Along the edges of the matrix, only one pathway is possible: straight to the right or down.<a0>We can calculate the number of possible pathways<a0>for the remaining<a0>number by adding the number to the right and below the point.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex p_{i,j}=p_{i,j-1}+p_{{i+1},j}$</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the two by two<a0>lattice the solution space is:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">6 <a0>3 <a0>1
3 <a0>2 <a0>1
1 <a0>1 <a0>0</p>

The total number of pathways from the upper left corner to the lower right corner is thus 6. This logic can now be applied to a grid of any arbitrary size using the following code. The code defines the lattice and initiates the boundary conditions. The bottom row and the right column are filled with 1 as there is only one solution from these points. The<a0>code then calculates the pathways by working backwards through the matrix. The final solution is the number is the first cell.

The king<a0>was happy with his humble request<a0>until his mathematicians worked out that it would take millions of tonnes of grain. Assuming there are <a href=""https://www.reference.com/food/many-grains-wheat-gram-88a4bf0a5a8ebff3"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">25 grains of wheat in a gramme</a>, the last field will contain more than 461,168,602,000 tonnes of grain.

<h2>Euler Problem 16 Definition</h2>

$latex 2^{15} = 32768$ and the sum of its digits is $latex 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26$. What is the sum of the digits of the number $latex 2^{1000}$?

<h2>Solution</h2>

The most straightforward solution uses the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html"">GMP</a><a0>package for Multiple Precision Arithmetic to calculate big integers. The as.bigz function results in a special class of arbitrarily large integer numbers.

231,euler-problem-17-number-letter-counts,Euler Problem 17: Number letter counts in various languages,"Euler Problem 17 asks to count the letters in numbers written as words. This is a skill we all learnt in primary school mainly useful when writing cheques<97>to those that still use them. The principle for this problem is similar to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-22-names-scores/"">Euler Problem 22</a>, which analyses given names.

Each language has its own rules for writing numbers. My native language Dutch has very different logic to English. Both Dutch and English use compound words after the number twelve.

Linguists have theorised this is evidence that early Germanic numbers were duodecimal. This factoid is supported by the importance of a ""dozen"" as a counting word and the twelve hours in the clock. There is even a Dozenal Society that promotes the use of a number system based on 12.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6xJfP7-HCc

The English language changes the rules when reaching the number 21. While we say eight-teen in English, we do no say ""one-twenty"". Dutch stays consistent and the last number is always spoken first. For example, 37 in English is ""thirty-seven"", while in Dutch<a0>it is written as ""zevenendertig"" (seven and thirty).

<h2>Euler Problem 17 Definition</h2>

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=17"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">how many letters would be used</a>?

NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of ""and"" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

<h2>Solution</h2>

The first piece of code provides a function that generates the words for numbers 1 to 999,999. This is more than the problem asks for, but it might be a useful function<a0>for another application.

4240,data-pseudo-science-calculating-biorhythm,Data Pseudo-Science: Developing a Biorhythm Calculator,"Data science is a serious occupation. Just like any other science, however, it can also be used for spurious topics, such as calculating your biorhythm. This article provides an example of data<a0>Pseudo-Science though a function that calculates and visualises your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biorhythm"">biorhythm</a>. Based on the graph, I must be having a great day right now.

The broader and more pertinent message in this post is that data pseudo-science is more common than you would think. Is our belief in machine learning justified or are some of these models also a pseudo-science with not much more reliability than a biorhythm?

<h2>Biorhythm Theory</h2>

The idea that our physical states follow a predetermined rhythm has been around as long as mathematics. The basic concept of biorhythm<a0>is that a regular sinusoid cycle accurately describes our physical, emotional and intellectual states.<a0>Each of these three cycles has a different wavelength ($latex w$):

<ul>
    <li>physical: $latex w = 23$ days</li>
    <li>emotional: $latex w = 28$ days</li>
    <li>intellectual: $latex w = 33$ days</li>
</ul>

The cycle is calculated with $latex \sin (2 \pi t / w)$, where $latex t$ indicates the number of days since birth. This idea was developed by German surgeon Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century<a0>and was popularised in the United States in the<a0>late 1970s. There is no scientific evidence of the validity of this theory, but it is an entertaining way to play with data.

The combination of the 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days, while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeat every 21,252 days, 58 years, two months and three weeks. You can, by the way, never reach a point where all cycles are maximised. The best you can achieve is 299.7 out of a maximum 300 which occurs when you are 17,003 days old.

<h2>Calculating your Biorhythm</h2>

When I was a teenager in the 1980s, several books and <a href=""http://www.atarimagazines.com/v6n9/Biorhythms.html"" rel=""noopener"">magazines</a> described computer code to calculate your biorhythm. I used to play with these functions on my <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family"" rel=""noopener"">Atari 130XE</a> computer.

Building a biorhythm calculator in R is easy. This function takes two dates as input and plots the biorhythm for the two weeks before and after the date. To calculate your biorhythm, run the function with your date of birth and target date: <code>biorhythm(""yyyy-mm-dd"")</code>. The default version uses today as the target.

<h2>Data Pseudo-Science</h2>

Biorhythms are an early attempt for human beings to predict the future. Although there is no relationship between this algorithm and reality, many people believed in its efficacy. Does the same hold true for the hyped capabilities of machine learning?

Data pseudo-science is not only an issue<a0>when people use spurious mathematical relationships such as biorhythms or astrology. This post is also written as a warning not to solely rely on numerical models to predict qualitative aspects of life.

The recent failures in predicting the results of elections, even days before the event, are a case in point. There are many <a href=""https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/05/8-reasons-analytics-machine-learning-models-fail-deployed/"">reasons machine learning methods can go wrong</a>. When machine learning algorithms<a0>fail, they are often just as useful as a biorhythm. It would be fun to write a predictive analysis package for R using only pseudoscientific approaches such as I-Ching, astrology or biorhythm."

<h2>Human Players</h2>

This second code snippet lets a human player move by clicking anywhere on the graphic display using the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/locator.html"" rel=""noopener"">locator</a> function. The click location is converted to a number to denote the position on the board.<a0>The entered field is only accepted if it has not yet been used (the <em>empty</em> variable contains the available fields).

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Human player"">move.human &lt;- function(game) {
    text(4, 0, ""Click on screen to move"", col = ""grey"", cex=.7)

        coords$y &lt;- floor(abs(coords$y) / 10) + 1
        move &lt;- coords$x + 3 * (3 - coords$y)
    }
    return (move)
}</pre>

<h2>Evaluate the Game</h2>

This code snippet defines the <em>eval.game</em> function which assesses the current board and assigns a score. Zero means no outcome, -6 indicates that the <em>X</em> player has won and +6 implies that the <em>O</em> player has won.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Evaluation"">eval.game &lt;- function(game, player) {
    # Determine game score
    square &lt;- t(matrix(game, nrow = 3))
    hor &lt;- rowSums(square)
    ver &lt;- colSums(square)
    diag1 &lt;- sum(diag(square))
    diag2 &lt;- sum(diag(t(apply(square, 2, rev))))
    eval &lt;- c(hor, ver, diag1, diag2)
    # Determine best score
    minimax &lt;- ifelse(player == -1, ""min"", ""max"")
    best.score &lt;- do.call(minimax, list(eval))
    if (abs(best.score) == 3) best.score &amp;lt;- best.score * 2
    return (best.score)
}</pre>

<h2>Computer Moves</h2>

The computer uses a modified <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax"">Minimax Algorithm</a> to determine its next move. This article from the <a href=""http://neverstopbuilding.com/minimax"" rel=""noopener"">Never Stop Building</a> blog and the video below explain this method in great detail.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kFKnB6JtcY

The next function determines the computer's move.<a0>I have not used a brute-force minimax algorithm to save running time. I struggled to build a fully recursive minimax function. Perhaps somebody can help me with this. This code looks only two steps deep and contains a strategic rule to maximise the score.

The first line stores the value of the players move, the second remainder of the matrix holds the evaluations of all the opponent's moves. The code adds a<a0>randomised variable, based on the strategic value of a field. The centre has the highest value because it<a0>is part of four winning lines. Corners have three winning lines and the rest only two winning lines.

This logic means that the computer will, all things being equal, favour the centre over the corners and favour the other fields least. The randomised variables in the code ensure<a0>that the computer does not always pick the same field in a similar situation.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Minimax"">move.computer &lt;- function(game, player) {
    empty &lt;- which(game == 0)
    eval &lt;- matrix(nrow = 10, ncol = 9, data = 0)
    for (i in empty) {
        game.tmp &lt;- game
        game.tmp[i] &lt;- player
        eval[1, i] &lt;- eval.game(game.tmp, player)
        empty.tmp &lt;- which(game.tmp == 0)
        for (j in empty.tmp) {
            game.tmp1 &lt;- game.tmp
            game.tmp1[j] &lt;- -player
            eval[(j + 1), i] &lt;- eval.game(game.tmp1, -player)
        }
    }
    if (!any(abs(eval[1,]) == 6)) { # When winning, play move
        # Analyse opponent move
        minimax &lt;- ifelse(player == -1, ""max"", ""min"") # Minimax
        best.opponent &lt;- apply(eval[-1,], 1, minimax)
        eval[1,] &lt;- eval[1,] * -player * best.opponent
    }
    # Add randomisation and strategic values
    board &lt;- c(3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3, 2, 3) # Strategic values
    board &lt;- sapply(board, function(x) runif(1, 0.1 * x, (0.1 * x) + 0.1)) # Randomise
    eval[1, empty] &lt;- eval[1, empty] + player * board[empty] # Randomise moves
    # Pick best game
    minimax &lt;- ifelse(player == -1, ""which.min"", ""which.max"") # Minimax
    move &lt;- do.call(minimax, list(eval[1,])) # Select best move
    return(move)
}</pre>

This last code snippet enables computers and humans play each other or themselves. The <em>players</em> vector contains the identity of the two players so that a human can play a computer or vice versa. The human player moves by clicking on the screen. The loop keeps running until the board is full or a winner has been identified. A<a0><a href=""http://lucidmanager.org/tic-tac-toe-simulation/"">previous Tic Tac<a0>Toe post</a><a0>explains the <em>draw.board</em> function.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Play game"">tic.tac.toe &lt;- function(player1 = ""human"", player2 = ""computer"") {
    game &lt;- rep(0, 9) # Empty board
    winner &lt;- FALSE # Define winner
    player &lt;- 1 # First player
    players &lt;- c(player1, player2)
    draw.board(game)
    while (0 %in% game &amp;amp; !winner) { # Keep playing until win or full board
        if (players[(player + 3) %% 3] == ""human"") # Human player
            move &lt;- move.human(game)
        else # Computer player
            move &lt;- move.computer(game, player)
        game[move] &lt;- player # Change board
        draw.board(game)
        # Winner, winner, chicken dinner?
        winner &lt;- max(eval.game(game, 1), abs(eval.game(game, -1))) == 6 
        player &lt;- -player # Change player
    }
}</pre>

You can play the computer by running all functions and then entering <code>tic.tac.toe()</code> I am pretty confident this simplified minimax algorithm is unbeatable<97>why don't you try to win and let me know when you do.

<h2>Tic Tac Toe War Games</h2>

Now that this problem is solved, I can finally recreate the epic scene from the WarGames movie. The Tic Tac Toe War Games code uses the functions explained above and the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">animation package</a>. Unfortunately, there are not many opportunities to create sound in R.

From the day I first saw this miracle box, I wanted to know more about computers.

I learnt how to write code from the 1983 book<a0><a href=""https://archive.org/details/Dr_Wackos_Guide_to_Creating_Arcade_Games"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dr. C. Wacko's Miracle Guide to Designing and Programming your own Atari Computer Arcade Games</a>. This book explains in a very clear and humorous<a0>way how to write computer games in Atari basic. I devoured this book and spent many hours developing silly games. This article is an ode to Dr Wacko, a computer geek's midlife-crisis and an attempt to replicate the software I developed thirty years ago.

Wacko's miracle guide to designing and programming your own Atari computer arcade games"" width=""1024"" height=""731"" /></a>

I showed in a previous post that R can be used for board<a0><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tag/r-games/"">games</a> or play a game of <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-144/"">elliptical pool</a>. The question is whether<a0>we create arcade<a0>games in R.<a0>My challenge is to recreate the look and feel of 1980s arcade games, or <em>R-Cade</em> games, using R? The code shown below simulates<a0>the legendary game of pong.

<h2>Playing Pong in R</h2>

The code is based on the Wacko's<em> Boing Program</em> in the above-mentioned book. The R code<a0>is fully commented and speaks for itself. Please note that the animation is very clunky when you run it in <a href=""https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200488548-Problem-with-Plots-or-Graphics-Device"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">RStudio</a>.<a0>Only<a0>the native R Terminal displays the animation correctly.

Perhaps somebody can help me perfect this little ditty. I love to know how to read real-time USB input to control the game, so we get a step closer to the first R-Cade game.

In this post, I kill two Eulers with one code. These two problems are logically similar to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-15-lattice-paths/"">Euler problem 15</a>.

These two problems concern <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">binary trees</a>, which is a data structure where each node has two children. A practical example of a binary tree is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">pedigree chart</a>, where each person or animal has two parents, four grandparents and so on. In this Project Euler problem we need to navigate through the tree.

<h2>Euler Problem 18 Definition</h2>

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

As there are only 16,384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=67"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Problem 67</a>, is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a clever method! ;o)

<h2>Solution</h2>

This problem seeks a <a href=""http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-sum-in-a-binary-tree/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">maximum path sum in a binary tree.</a><a0>The brute force method, as indicated in the problem definition, is a very inefficient way to solve this problem. The video visualises the quest for the maximum<a0>path, which takes eleven minutes of<a0>hypnotic<a0>animation.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-AOWBztnpI

A more efficient method is to define the maximum path layer by layer, starting at the bottom. The maximum sum of 2+8 or 2+5 is 10, the maximum sum of 4+5 or 4+9 is 13 and the last maximum sum is 15. These numbers are now placed in the next row. This process cycles until only one number is left. This algorithm solves the sample triangle in four steps:

Step 1:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3</p>

Step 2:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">3

10 13 15</p>

Step 3:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">3
20<a0>19</p>

Step 4:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">23</p>

In the code below, the data is triangle matrix.<a0>The variables <em>rij</em> (row) and <em>kol</em><a0>(column) drive the search for the maximum path. The triangle for Euler Problem 18 is manually created and the triangle for Euler Problem 67 is read from the website.

<h2>Which day does the week start?</h2>

The only aspect remotely interesting about this problem is the conversion from weekdays to numbers. In R, Monday is considered day one, which makes sense in the Christian context of Western culture. Saturday and Sunday are the weekends, the two last days of the week so they are day 6 and 7. According to international standard <a href=""http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ISO 8601</a>, Monday is the first day of the week. Although this is the international standard, several countries, including the United States and Canada, consider Sunday to be the first day of the week.

The international standard is biased towards Christianity. The Christian or Western world marks Sunday as their day of rest and worship. Muslims refer to Friday as their day of rest and prayer. The Jewish calendar counts Saturday<97>the Sabbath<97>as the day of rest and worship. This idea is also shared by Seventh-Day Adventists.

312,euler-problem-20,Euler Problem 20: Large Integer Factorials,"Euler Problem 20 is the third problem that requires special consideration for working with very large integers. In this problem, we look at<a0><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">factorials</a>. These numbers are useful in combinatorics if, for example, you like to know in how many ways you can arrange a deck of cards.

The problem with computing factorials is that they are mostly very large numbers, beyond the generic capabilities of computers to process.<a0>For exmaple, a huble pack of playing card can be shuffled in $latex 52! = 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000$ different configurations.

<h2>Euler Problem 20 Definition</h2>

$latex n! =<a0>n \times (n -<a0>1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1.$

For example: $latex <a0>10! = 10 \times 9 \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800$.

The sum of the digits in the number $latex 10!$ is $latex 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0<a0>= 27$.

<a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Find the sum</a> of the digits in the number 100!

<h2>Euler Problem 20 Solution</h2>

The<a0>factorial of the number 100 contains 158 digits, which is a lot more digits than a 64-bit operating system can accurately produce. Using the standard function: <code>factorial(100) = 9.332622e+157</code>. Without using a specialised algorithm, we cannot determine the<a0>sum of all digits. We need to deploy<a0><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">arbitrary-precision arithmetic</a><a0>to solve this problem.

This problem can be solved using a specialised R package and using only base-R code. Many computer languages, including R, have special libraries to deal with such large numbers. The <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gmp/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GMP<a0>Multiple Precision Arithmetic</a> package<a0>renders this problem almost trivial.

answer &lt;- sum(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(digits, """"))))</pre>

<h2>Base-R Code</h2>

The problem becomes more interesting when only using basic R code.<a0>I developed the big.add function to solve<a0><a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-13/"">Euler Problem 13</a><a0>through the addition of very large integers. We can extend this function to also calculate factorials. A factorial can be replaced by a series of additions, for example:

$latex 3! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 = (((1+1) + (1+1)) + (1+1))$

This can be mimicked in R using the<a0><a href=""http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html#functionals-fp"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Reduce function</a>.<a0>This function reduces a vector<a0>to a single value by recursively calling a function.<a0><code>Reduce(""+"", rep(4, 5))</code> is the same as:

$latex 4 \times 5 = ((((4 + 4) + 4) + 4) + 4) = 20$

Using a loop, we can use the Reduce function to calculate a factorial, using only additions:

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""The Reduce function"">fact &lt;- 1
x &lt;- 100
for (i in 2:x) {
    fact &lt;- Reduce(""+"", rep(fact, i))
}
print(fact)</pre>

The <code>big.factorial</code> function below implements this idea by combining the <code>big.add</code> and <code>Reduce</code> functions to calculate large integer factorials. The function returns a value of 1 when the factorial of 0 or 1 is requested. This function does not calculate the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Gamma-function</a> for fractions. For all other values, it goes through a loop from 2 to the requested factorial. The temporary values are stored in the <em>bf</em> variable. The code loops through the factorials by<a0>using the result of the previous <em>Reduce</em><a0>call into the current one.

<pre>big.factorial &lt;- function(x) {
    x &lt;- floor(x)
    bf &lt;- 1 if (x &gt; 1) {
        for (i in 2:x) {
            bf &lt;- Reduce(big.add, rep(bf,i))

    }
return (bf)
}

digits &lt;- big.factorial(100)
answer &lt;- sum(as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(as.character(digits), """"))))

This function is most certainly not as fast as the GMP package but it was fun to write and to learn about the mechanics behind arbitrary precision arithmetic at work.

A related concept is a<a0><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number"">perfect number</a>, which is a number that equals the sum of its proper divisors.

Amicable numbers were known to the <a title=""Pythagoreanism"" href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-9/"">Pythagoreans</a>, who credited them with many mystical properties. Before we had access to computers, finding amicable numbers was a task that required a lot of patience.

Medieval Muslim mathematicians developed several formulas to create amicable numbers, but the only way to be complete is using brute force.

<h2>Euler Problem 21 Definition</h2>

Let $latex d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than $latex n$ which divide evenly into n). If $latex d(a) = b$ and $latex d(b) = a$, where $latex a \neq b$, then $latex a$ and $latex b$ are an amicable pair and each of $latex a$ and $latex b$ are called amicable numbers.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore $latex d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so, $latex d(284) = 220$.</p>

<a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=21"">Evaluate the sum</a> of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

The first part of the code provides for a<a0>function to list all proper divisors for a given integer <em>x</em>.<a0>The loop<a0>determines the divisors for the numbers 220 to 10,000, calculates their sum and then checks if<a0>these numbers are amicable.

<h2>The Chaos Game</h2>

A fascinating method to create a Sierpinski Triangle is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">chaos game</a>. This method uses random numbers and some simple arithmetic rules. Sierpinski<a0>Triangles can be created using the following six steps:

<ol>
    <li>Define three points in a plane to form a triangle.</li>
    <li>Randomly select any point on the plane.</li>
    <li>Randomly select any one of the three triangle points.</li>
    <li>Move half the distance from your current position to the selected vertex.</li>
    <li>Plot the current position.</li>
    <li>Repeat from step 3.</li>
</ol>

This fractal is an implementation of chaos theory as this random process attracts to<a0>a complex ordered geometry. The game only works with random numbers and when selecting random vertices of the triangle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs

<h2>Sierpinski Triangle Code</h2>

This code implements the six rules in R. The code first initialises the triangle, defines a random starting point and then runs a loop to place random dots.<a0>The R plot engine does not draw pixels but uses characters, which implies that the diagram is not as accurate as it could be but the general principle is clear. The <code>x11()</code> and <code>Sys.sleep()</code> commands are used to<a0>plot during the for-loop.

These are numbers for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself.

Twelve is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (the aliquot sum) is larger than 12: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16). All<a0><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">highly composite numbers</a> or anti-primes greater than six are abundant numbers. These are numbers that have so many divisors that they are considered the opposite of primes, as explained in the Numberphile video below.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM2oImb9Qg

<h2>Euler Problem 23 Definition</h2>

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number. A number <em>n</em> is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds <em>n</em>.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis, even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

I thought the common strategy rules (start in the centre and occupy the corners) would make the program unbeatable. When I simulated the game by instructing the computer to play against itself, Alberto's strategy never arose because the code forces the centre<a0>field. Alberto's code shows that you need to look at least three moves ahead for a perfect game. Alberto has been so kind to share his code and permission to publish it.

Alberto recreated two functions, for completeness I have added the complete working code that merges his improvements with my earlier work. The first two functions are identical to the previous post. These functions draw the game board and process the human player's move by waiting for a mouse click.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Getting started"">draw.board &lt;- function(game) {
    xo &lt;- c(""X"", "" "", ""O"") # Symbols
    par(mar = rep(1,4))
    plot.new()
    plot.window(xlim = c(0,30), ylim = c(0,30))
    abline(h = c(10, 20), col=""darkgrey"", lwd = 4)
    abline(v = c(10, 20), col=""darkgrey"", lwd = 4)
    text(rep(c(5, 15, 25), 3), c(rep(25, 3), rep(15,3), rep(5, 3)), xo[game + 2], cex = 4)
    # Identify location of any three in a row
    square &lt;- t(matrix(game, nrow = 3))
    hor &lt;- abs(rowSums(square))
    if (any(hor == 3)) 
        hor &lt;- (4 - which(hor == 3)) * 10 - 5 
    else 
        hor &lt;- 0
    ver &lt;- abs(colSums(square))
    if (any(ver == 3)) 
        ver &lt;- which(ver == 3) * 10 - 5 
    else
        ver &lt;- 0

    diag2 &lt;- sum(diag(t(apply(square, 2, rev))))

    if (all(ver &gt; 0)) for (i in ver) lines(rep(i, 2), c(0, 30), lwd = 10, col=""red"")
    if (abs(diag1) == 3) lines(c(2, 28), c(28, 2), lwd = 10, col = ""red"")
    if (abs(diag2) == 3) lines(c(2, 28), c(2, 28), lwd = 10, col = ""red"")
}

# Human player enters a move

        move &lt;- coords$x + 3 * (3 - coords$y)
    }
    return (move)
}</pre>

Alberto rewrote the functions that analyse the board and determine the move of the computer.<a0>The<a0><em>ganador</em><a0>(Spanish for winning) function assesses the board condition by assigning -10 or + 10 for a winning game and 0 for any other situation.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Evaluate game"">ganador &lt;- function(juego, player) {
    game &lt;- matrix(juego, nrow = 3, byrow = T)
    hor &lt;- rowSums(game)

    diag &lt;- c(sum(diag(game)), sum(diag(apply(game, 1, rev))))
    if (-3 %in% c(hor, ver, diag))
        return(-10)
    if (3 %in% c(hor, ver, diag))
        return(10)
    else
        return(0)
}</pre>

<h2>Tic Tac Toe Minimax</h2>

The next function is the Tic Tac Toe minimax algorithm. If the computer starts then the first move ($latex 9!= 362880$ options to assess) takes a little while. The commented lines can be used to force a corner and make the games faster by forcing a random corner.

The minimax function returns a list with the move and its valuation through the ganador function. The function works recursively until it has filled the board and retains the best scoring move using the minimax method. To avoid the computer always playing the same move in the same situation random variables are added.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Minimax"">minimax &lt;- function(juego, player) {
    free &lt;- which(juego == 0)
    if(length(free) == 1) {
        juego[free] &lt;- player
        return(list(move = free, U = ganador(juego, player)))
    }
    poss.results &lt;- rep(0, 9)
    for(i in free) {
        game &lt;- juego
        game[i] &lt;- player
        poss.results[i] &lt;- ganador(game, player)
    }
    mm &lt;- ifelse(player == -1, ""which.min"", ""which.max"")
    if(any(poss.results == (player * 10))) {
        move &lt;- do.call(mm, list(poss.results))
        return(list(move = move, U = poss.results[move]))
    }
    for(i in free) {
        game &lt;- juego
        game[i] &lt;- player
        poss.results[i] &lt;- minimax(game, -player)$U
    }
    random &lt;- runif(9, 0, 0.1)
    poss.results[-free] &lt;- 100 * -player
    poss.results &lt;- poss.results + (player * random)
    move &lt;- do.call(mm, list(poss.results))
    return(list(move = move, U = poss.results[move]))
}</pre>

This final function stitches everything together and lets you play the game. Simply paste all functions in your R console and run them to play a game. The tic.tac.toe function can take two parameters, ""human"" and/or ""computer"". The order of the parameters determines who starts the game.

This is my last word on Tic Tac Toe but now that the minimax conundrum is solved I could start working on other similar games such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Connect Four</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Draughts</a> or even the royal game of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Chess</a>.

Tushar Roy of <em>Coding Made Simple</em> has shared a great introduction on how to generate lexicographic permutations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYFd7VHKyWQ

<h2>Euler Problem 24 Definition</h2>

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012 021 102 120 201 210

What is the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=24"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">millionth lexicographic permutation</a> of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

<h2>Brute Force Solution</h2>

The digits 0 to 9 have $latex 10! =<a0>3628800$ permutations (including combinations that start with 0). Most of these permutations are, however, not in lexicographic order. A brute-force way to solve the problem is to<a0>determine the next lexicographic permutation of a number string and repeat this one million times.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Brute force"">nextPerm &lt;- function(a) {

    <li>Reverse the suffix starting at $latex a_i$.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Combinatorics</h2>

A more efficient solution is to use combinatorics, thanks to <a href=""http://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-24-millionth-lexicographic-permutation/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MathBlog</a>. The last nine digits can be ordered in $latex 9! = 362880$ ways. So the first $latex 9!$ permutations start with a 0. By extending this thought, it follows that the millionth permutation must start with<a0>a 2.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex \lfloor (1000000 - 1) / 9! \rfloor <a0>= 2$</p>

From this<a0>rule, it follows that the 725761<sup>st</sup> permutation is 2013456789. We now need 274239 more lexicographic permutations:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex (1000000 - 1) - (2 \times 9!) = 274239$</p>

We can repeat this logic to find the next digit. The last 8 digits can be ordered in 40320 ways.<a0>The second digit is the 6th digit in the remaining numbers, which is 7 (2013456789).

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex \lfloor 274239 / 8! \rfloor <a0>= 6$</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex 274239 - (6 \times 7!) = 32319$</p>

This process is repeated until all digits have been used. View the code bleow or download the latest version from <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/ProjectEuler/problem024.R"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

The<a0>Fibonacci sequence follows a simple mathematical rule but it can create things of great beauty. This pattern occurs quite often in nature, like to nautilus shell shown in the image.

<h2>Large Integers in R</h2>

By default, numbers with more than 7 digits are shown in scientific notation in R, which reduces the accuracy<a0>of the calculation. You can change the precision of large integers with the <em>options</em> function but<a0>R struggles with integers with more than 22 digits. This example illustrates this issue.

However, finding a number of 1000 digits is a problem with using special functions.

<h2>Euler Problem 25 Definition</h2>

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$latex F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $, where $latex F_1 = 1$ and $latex F_2 = 1$. The 12<sup>th</sup> term, $latex F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=25"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits</a>?

<h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>

The first solution uses the GMP library to manage very large integers. This library also contains a function to generate Fibonacci numbers. This solution cycles through the Fibonacci sequence until it finds a number with 1000 digits.

776,euler-problem-26,The Viral Recurring Decimal: Euler Problem 26,"A few years ago a fraction broke the internet. What happens when you divide 1 by 998001?

$latex \frac{1}{998001} = 0.000001002003004005006007008009010011012013014015 \ldots $

What is special about this fraction is that it lists every three-decimal number except for 998. Look carefully at the sequence to see that is 000, 001, 0002, 003, 004, 005 and so on. After it has reached 999, the sequence continues from the start. This fraction thus has 2997 recurring decimals. James Grime from <a href=""http://www.numberphile.com/"" rel=""noopener"">Numberphile</a> explains this mathematical oddity with his usual enthusiasm.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daro6K6mym8

The decimal fraction of 1/998001 is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal"" rel=""noopener"">recurring decimal</a>. These are decimal numbers with periodic digits (repeating its values at regular intervals). Euler problem 26 asks us to analyse recurring decimals (reciprocal cycles). Euler Problem 33 also looks at fractions and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-33-ford-circles/"">Ford Circles</a>.

<h2>Euler Problem 26 Definition</h2>

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
$latex 1/2 = 0.5 $
$latex 1/3 = 0.(3) $
$latex 1/4 = 0.25 $
$latex 1/5 = 0.2 $
$latex 1/6 = 0.1(6) $
$latex 1/7 = 0.(142857) $
$latex 1/8 = 0.125 $
$latex 1/9 = 0.(1) $
$latex 1/10 = 0.1 $

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666<85>, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle. Find the value of d &lt; 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<a href=""https://oeis.org/A051626"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">A051626</a> describes the length of the recurring numbers in 1/n in the<a0><em>On-Line Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences</em>. To solve Euler Problem 26, we need to generate the first 1000 numbers of this sequence and find out which number has the longest recurring cycle.

R can only display up to 22 decimals by using <code>options(digits=22)</code>.<a0>The base R capability is unsuitable for solving this problem, so I wrote some code to perform long division the old-fashioned way.

The <code>recur</code> function divides 1 by any arbitrary integer. The code continues until the decimal terminates, for example 1/4 = 0.25, or when a recurring pattern emerges, e.g. 1/7 = 0.(142857).

The function has two arguments: <code>n</code> is the input number. The <code>output</code> argument determines the outcome of the function: ""len"" for the length of the recurring decimals. Any other value shows the result of the calculation. The output of the function is a string. Using the European notation, the recurring part of the decimals is shown between brackets, e.g. 1/14 =<a0>0.0(714285).

This impossibility has not stopped mathematicians from trying to find formulas to generate prime numbers. Euler problem 27 deals with quadratic formulas that can be used to generate sets of prime numbers. I have already discussed this in the article about the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-28/"">Ulam Spiral</a>. This Numerphile video discusses quadratic primes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K-12i0jclM

<h2>Euler Problem 27 Definition</h2>

Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex n^2+n+41$</p>

It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $latex 0 \leq n \leq 39$. However, when $latex n=40$, $latex 40^2+40+41=40(40+1)+41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $latex n=41 &amp;s=2$, $latex 41^2+41+41$ is clearly divisible by $latex 41$.

The incredible formula $latex n^2-79n+1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $latex 0 \leq n \leq 79$. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.

Considering quadratics of the form: $latex n^2+an+bn^2+an+b$, where $latex |a| &lt; 1000$ and $latex |b| \leq 1000$, where $latex |n| $ is the modulus/absolute value of $latex n$, e.g. $latex |11|=11$ and $latex |-4|=4 $.

<a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=27"" rel=""noopener"">Find the product of the coefficients</a>, $latex a$ and $latex b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $latex n$, starting with $latex n=0$.

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

The only way to solve this problem is through brute force and reduce the solution space to optimise it for speed (source: <a href=""http://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-27-quadratic-formula-primes-consecutive-values/"" rel=""noopener"">mathblog.dk</a>). Because the outcome of the equation must be prime for $latex n = 0$, $latex b$ also has to be prime. We can use the prime sieve from <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-3/"">Euler Problem 3</a>, which reduces it from 2000 to 168 options. When we insert $latex n = 1$, it follows that a has to be an even number. If $latex 1+a+b$ has to be prime and b has to be a prime number, then a can only be an odd number. However, when $latex b = 2$, $latex a$, also has to be even.

<h2>The Enron Corpus</h2>

As part of their inquiries, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission used an extensive collection of emails from Enron employees. The Enron corpus is one of the only publicly available collections of emails available for research. This dataset also provides a fascinating playground for citizen data scientists.

The set has privacy issues as it contains messages from living people. When analysing this data set, we need to keep in mind that the majority of former Enron employees were innocent people who lost their jobs due to the greed of their overlords. The code in this post only analyses the e-mail headers, ignoring the content.

The Enron Corpus is an extensive database of half a million emails generated by more than 100 Enron employees. You can download the corpus from the <a href=""https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/"" rel=""noopener"">Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science</a>.

<h2>Preparing the Enron email</h2>

The main folder is <code>maildir</code>, which holds all the personal accounts. Our first task is to load the required libraries and create a list of available emails. This code results in 517,401 e-mail files with 44,859 emails in the inboxes of users. The E-mail corpus consists of nested folders per user with e-mails as text files.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Extract emails"">emails &lt;- list.files(""maildir/"", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
emails &lt;- emails[grep(""/inbox"", emails)]</pre>

The bulk of the code creates a list of emails between Enron employees. The code performs a lot of string manipulations to extract the information from the text files. The content of the e-mails is ignored, the code only retrieves the sender and the receiver. The analysis is limited to e-mails between employees in the corpus. Only those receivers whose inbox forms part of the analysis are included. The result of this code is a data frame with the usernames of the sender and receiver for each email. The data frame contains 2779 emails that meet the criteria.

The code below looks extracts all internal emails in the Inox folders. It then retrieves a lis of usernames from the e-mails. The data is cleaned by removing users without sent e-mails, and emails which users sent to themselves.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Extract data"">inboxes &lt;- data.frame(
    from = apply(as.data.frame(emails), 1,

<h2>Analyse the Enron Corpus</h2>

The last code snippet defines a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)"" rel=""noopener"">graph</a> from the table of e-mails. Each employee is a node in the network, and each e-mail is an edge (line). The iGraph package is a powerful tool to analyse networks. The <code>graph_from_edgelist</code> function creates a network object that can be analysed using the iGraph package. The graph is directed because the information flows from the sender to the receiver.

In the next step, the Spingglass algorithm finds <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure"" rel=""noopener"">community structure</a> within the data. A community is a group of nodes that are more connected with each other than with any other node.

The last step visualises the network. The diagram is drawn using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, which places the most connected nodes at the centre of the picture. The background colours in the diagram indicate the eight communities.

The graph tells us a lot about the group of employees in the Enron corpus and how they relate to each other. Each of the communities represents a tightly connected group of employees that mainly e-mail each other. Any connections between communities are shown in red. When the <code>vertex.label = NA</code> line is removed, the usernames are displayed at each node.

We can see groups that never email each other, lonely hangers-on and tightly knit cliques within Enron. In the centre of the graph, we see a few individuals who are connectors between groups because they send a lot of emails to people outside their community. On the fringes of the graph are the hangers-on who only once or twice emailed somebody in the corpus but were still included in the investigation.

This is a spiral that contains sequential positive integers in a square spiral, marking the prime numbers. Stanislaw Ulam discovered that a lot of primes are located along the diagonals. These diagonals can be described as polynomials. The Ulam Spiral is thus a way of generating quadratic primes (<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/quadratic-primes-euler-problem-27/"">Euler Problem 27</a>).

<h2>Euler Problem 28 Definition</h2>

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">21</span> 22 23 24 <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">25</span>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101. What is the <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=28"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">sum of the numbers on the diagonals in </a>a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

To solve this problem we do not need to create a matrix.<a0>This code calculates the values of the corners of a matrix with size $latex n &amp;s=1$. The lowest number in the matrix with size $latex n &amp;s=1$ is $latex n(n-3)+4$. The numbers increase by $latex n-1 &amp;s=1$. The code steps through all matrices from size 3 to 1001. The solution uses only the uneven sized matrices because these have a centre. The answer to the problem is the sum of all numbers.

My talk was about how to create value from SCADA data, using a method I developed with my colleagues called<a0><em>Virtual Tags</em>. My talk started with my views on data science strategy, which I also presented to the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/data-science-business/"">R User Group</a> in Melbourne. In this post, I like to explain what Virtual Tags are, and how they can be used to improve the value of <a href=""http://awa.asn.au/AWA_MBRR/Publications/Latest_News/Water_utilities_ready_for_next_wave_of_SCADA_data_analysis.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">SCADA data</a>.

<h2>SCADA Systems at Water Treatment Plants</h2>

Water treatment plants are mostly fully automated systems, using analysers and the SCADA system to communicate this data. For those of you not familiar with water treatment plants, this video below gives a cute summary of the process.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj44AkHmVCo

Water treatment plants need sensors to measure a broad range of parameters. These instruments<a0>record data 24 hours per day to control operations. When the process operates effectively, all values fall within a very narrow band. All these values are stored by the SCADA system for typically a year, after which they are destroyed to save storage space.

Water treatment plants measure <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbidity"" rel=""noopener"">turbidity</a> (clarity of the water) to assess the effectiveness of filtration.<a0>The code snippet below simulates the measurements from a turbidity instrument at a water treatment plant over five hours. The code simulates measurements from a turbidity instrument at a water treatment plant over a period of five hours. Most water quality data has a log-normal distribution with a narrow standard deviation.

<h2>SCADA Historian</h2>

The data generated by the SCADA system is used to take operational decisions. The data is created and structured to make decisions in the present, not to solve problems in the future. SCADA Historian systems archive this information for future analysis. Historian systems only store new values when the new reading is more or less than a certain percentage than the previous one. This method saves storage space without sacrificing much accuracy.

For example, when an instrument reads 0.20 and the limit is set at 5%, new values are only recorded when they are below 0.19 or above 0.21. Any further values are stored when they deviate 5% from the new value, and so on. The code snippet below simulates this behaviour, based on the simulated turbidity readings generated earlier. This Historian only stores the data points marked in black.

<h2>Virtual Tags</h2>

This standard method to generate and store SCADA data works fine to operate systems but does not work so well when using the data for posthoc analysis. The data in Historian is an unequally-spaced time series which makes it harder to analyse the data. The Virtual Tag approach expands these unequal time series to an equally-spaced one, using constant interpolation.
The <code>vt</code> function undertakes the constant interpolation using the <a href=""http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/stats/html/approxfun.html"" rel=""noopener"">approx function</a>. The function <code>vt</code> is applied to all the DateTime values, using the historised data points. The red line shows how the value is constant until it jumps by more than 5%. This example demonstrates that we have a steady process with some minor spikes, which is the expected outcome of this simulation.

The next step in Virtual Tags is to combine the tags from different data points. For example, we are only interested in the turbidity readings when the filter was running. We can do this by combining this data with a valve status or flow in the filter.

This approach might seem cumbersome but it simplifies analysing data from Historian. Virtual Tags enables several analytical processes that would otherwise be hard to. This system also adds context to the SCADA information by linking tags to each other and the processes they describe.<a0>If you are interested in more detail, then please download the<a0><a href=""http://colibanwater.github.io/HBT/"" rel=""noopener"">technical manual</a> for Virtual Tags<a0>and how they are implemented in SQL.

This chapter is based on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/data-science-strategy-water-utilities/"">earlier articles</a> and recent <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/data-science-business/"">presentations</a> on the topic.

<h2>Using R</h2>

This chapter will make a case for using R by providing just enough information for readers to be able to follow the code in the book. A recurring theme at a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/virtual-tags/"">data conference</a> in Auckland I spoke at was the problems posed by the high reliance on spreadsheets. This chapter will explain why code is superior and how to use R to achieve this advantage.

<h2>Reservoirs</h2>

This first practical chapter will discuss how to manage data from reservoirs. The core problem is to find the relationship<a0>between depth and volume based on bathymetric survey data. I started toying with bathymetric data from <a href=""http://www.mgs.md.gov/coastal_geology/prettyboy.html"" rel=""noopener"">Pretyboy Reservoir</a> in the state of Mayne. The code below downloads and visualises this data.

In the plot, you can see the lines where the survey boat took soundings. I am working on converting this survey data to a non-convex hull to calculate its volume and to determine the relationship between depth and volume.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Other areas to be covered in this chapter could be hydrology and meteorology, but alas I am not qualified in these subjects. I hope to find somebody who can help me with this part.</p>

<h2>Water Quality</h2>

The quality of water in tanks and networks is tested using samples. One of the issues in analysing water quality data is the low number of data points due to the cost of laboratory testing. There has been some discussion about how to correctly calculate <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/percentile-calculations/"">percentiles</a><a0>and other statistical issues.

This chapter will also describe how to create a <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326533569_Visualising_water_quality_A_graphical_index_for_drinking_water_system_performance"" rel=""noopener"">water system index</a> to communicate the performance of a water system to non-experts. The last topic in this chapter discusses analysing <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.5942/jawwa.2016.108.0192"" rel=""noopener"">taste testing</a> data.

<h2>Water Balance</h2>

We have developed a model to produce water balances based on SCADA data. I am currently generalising this idea by using the <em>igraph</em> package to define water network geometry. Next year I will start experimenting with a predictive model for water consumption that uses data from the Australian Census and historical data to predict future use.

<h2>SCADA Data</h2>

Data from <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/virtual-tags/"">SCADA systems</a> are time series. This chapter will discuss how to model this data, find <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/spike-detection/"">spikes</a> in the readings and conduct predictive analyses.

<h2>Customer Perception</h2>

This chapter is based on my <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/servaqua/"" rel=""noopener"">dissertation on customer perception</a>. Most water utilities do not extract the full value from their customer surveys. In this chapter, I will show how to analyse latent variables in survey data. The code below loads the cleaned data set of the results of a customer survey I undertook in Australia and the USA. The first ten variables are the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/consumer-involvement-with-tap-water/"" rel=""noopener"">Personal Involvement Index</a>. This code does a quick exploratory analysis using a boxplot and visualises a factor analysis that uncovers two latent variables.

<h2>Customer Complaints</h2>

Customer complaints are a gift to the business. Unfortunately, most business view complaints punitively. This chapter will explain how to analyse and respond to complaints to improve the level of service to customers.

<h2>Customer Contacts</h2>

One of the topics in this chapter is how to use Erlang-C modelling to predict staffing levels in contact centres.

<h2>Economics</h2>

Last but not least, economics is the engine room of any organisation. In the early stages of my career, I specialised in cost estimating, including probabilistic methods. This chapter will include an introduction to Monte Carlo simulation to improve cost estimation reliability.

<h2>Data Science for Water Utilities</h2>

This book is still in its early stages. I started writing bits and pieces of <em>Data Science for Water Utilities<a0></em>using the fabulous <a href=""https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/"" rel=""noopener"">bookdown</a> system in R-Studio, or perhaps Org Mode in <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/using-r-with-emacs/"">Emacs</a>. It will take me about a year to realise this vision as I need to increase my analytical skills to write about such a broad range of topics. I would love to get some feedback on these two questions:

<ol>
    <li>What is missing in this list? Any practical problems I should include?</li>
    <li>Would you like to donate some data and code to include in the book?</li>
</ol>

964,geographic-bubble-chart,Visualising Water Consumption using a Geographic Bubble Chart,"A geographic bubble chart is a straightforward method to visualise quantitative information with a geospatial relationship. Last week I was in Vietnam helping the Ph<fa> Th? Water Supply Joint Stock Company with their data science. They asked me to create a map of a sample of their water consumption data. In this post, I share this little ditty to explain how to plot a bubble chart over a map using the ggmap package.

In this post, I share this little ditty to explain how to plot a bubble chart over a map using the ggmap package. You can find the code and data for this article on my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Hydroinformatics/PhuTho"">GitHub</a> repository. With thanks to<a0>Ms Quy and Mr Tuyen of Phu Tho water for their permission to use this data. Other posts on this blog detail how to analyse water consumption from <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/digital-water-meter-data/"">digital metering data</a>.

This map visualises water consumption in the targeted area of Vi?t Tr<ec>. The larger the bubble, the larger the consumption. It is no surprise that two commercial customers used the most water. Ggplot<a0>automatically<a0>adds the legend for the consumption variable.

<h2>Load and Explore the Data</h2>

The sample data contains a list of just over 100 readings from water meters in the city of<a0>Vi?t Tr<ec> in Vietnam, plus their geospatial location. This data uses the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84), which is compatible with Google Maps and similar systems.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Load the data"">water &lt;- read.csv(""PhuTho/MeterReads.csv"")
water$Consumption &lt;- water$read_new - water$read_old
## Summarise the data
head(water)
summary(water$Consumption)</pre>

The consumption at each connection is between 0 and 529 cubic metres, with an average usage of 23.45 cubic metres.

<h2>Visualise the data with a geographic bubble chart</h2>

With the <a href=""https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/kahle-wickham.pdf"">ggmap</a> extension of the ggplot package, we can visualise any spatial data set on a map. The only condition is that the spatial coordinates are in the WGS84 datum. The ggmap package adds a geographical layer to ggplot by adding a Google Maps or Open Street Map canvas. The first step is to download the map canvas. To do this, you need to know the centre coordinates and the zoom factor. To determine the perfect zoon factor requires some trial and error. The ggmap<a0>package provides for various map types, which are described in detail in the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/ggmap.pdf"">documentation</a>.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Prepare map"">library(ggmap)
centre &lt;- c(mean(range(water$lon)), mean(range(water$lat)))
viettri &lt;- get_map(centre, zoom = 17, maptype = ""hybrid"")
g &lt;- ggmap(viettri)</pre>

The ggmap package follows the same conventions as ggplot. We first call the map layer and then add any required geom. The point geom creates a<a0>nice bubble chart when used in combination with the <code>scale_size_area option</code>. This option scales the points to a maximum size so that they are easily visible. The transparency (alpha) minimises problems with overplotting. This last code snippet plots the map with water consumption.

840,digit-fifth-powers-euler-problem-30,Digit fifth powers: Euler Problem 30,"Euler problem 30 is another number crunching problem that deals with numbers to the power of five. Two other Euler problems dealt with<a0>raising numbers to a power. The <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-29-distinct-powers/"">previous problem</a> looked at permutations of powers and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-16-power-digit-sum/"">problem 16</a> asks for the sum of the digits of $latex 2^{1000}$. Euler Problem 24 discusses <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-24/"">lexicographic permutations</a>.

<h2>Euler Problem 30 Definition</h2>

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

$latex 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4$

$latex 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4$

$latex 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4$

As $latex 1 = 1^4 $ is not a sum, it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $latex 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$. <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=30"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Find the sum</a> of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of the fifth powers of their digits.

<h2>Digit Sum</h2>

The mathematics in this problem is about the digit sum, which is the sum of all digits in the relevant number base.

The digit sum of a number $latex x$ in base 10 is given by:

$latex \sum_{n=0}^{\lfloor \log_{10} x\rfloor} \frac{1}{10^n}(x \bmod 10^{n + 1} - x \bmod 10^n) &amp;s=2$.

Cryptographers use these numbers are in cryptography and data validation. You can find the digital sum base-10 numbers in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer<a0>Sequences (<a href=""http://oeis.org/A007953"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">A007953</a>).

Checksum algorithms use digit sums as a quality assurance method. For example, the final digit in the ten-digit International Standard Book Numbers (<a href=""https://isbn-information.com/check-digit-for-the-13-digit-isbn.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ISBN</a>) is a check digit. You can compute the check digit by multiplying each digit by its position in the ISBN number (alternating by 3 and 1), and taking the sum of these products. The check digit is 0 when the modules 10 of this modulus is zero, otherwise it is 10 minust he remainder. In R code, determining the check digit for a 13-digit ISBN number works as follows:

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Check ISBN 13"">check_isbn13 &lt;- function(isbn) {
    isbn &lt;- gsub("" |-"", """", isbn)
    check_sum &lt;- 0
    for (i in 1:12) {
        m &lt;- ifelse(i %% 2 == 0, 3, 1)
        check_sum &lt;- check_sum + m * as.numeric(substr(isbn, i, i))
    }
    check_sum &lt;- ifelse(check_sum %% 10 == 0, 0, 10 - check_sum %% 10)
    check_sum == substr(isbn, 13, 13)
}
check_isbn13(""978-0-9875669-4-2"")</pre>

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

The problem asks for a brute-force solution but we have a halting problem. How far do we need to go before we can be certain there are no sums of fifth power digits? Do we need to search until infinity, which means we can never solve the problem? We can limit the solution space because the solution will have lower and upper limits. The upper bound is a number $latex a \cdot 9^5 $ with $latex a $ digits.

In base ten, the highest digit is $latex 9$ and $latex 9^5=59049$, which has five digits. This implies that<a0>the highest possible number which equals the sum of the fifth power of its digits is $latex 5 times 9^5=295245$. The lowest possible number is $latex 2 times 2^5 = 64$. All numbers with this property thus must range between these two values.

The code to solve this project first declares the exponent and determines the lower and upper boundaries of the solution space. Change the variable $latex n$ to try other exponents. The loop cycles through the digits of each number and tests whether the sum of the fifth powers equals the number. You can view the code below or download it from<a0><a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/ProjectEuler/problem030.R"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

<h2>With the Fifth Power Comes Great Responsibility</h2>

809,pacific-island-hopping,Pacific Island Hopping using R and iGraph,"Last month I enjoyed a relaxing holiday in the <a href=""https://horizonofreason.com/vanuatu-sand-drawings-sandroing/"" rel=""noopener"">tropical paradise of Vanuatu</a>. One rainy day I contemplated how to go island hopping across the Pacific ocean visiting as many island nations as possible. The Pacific ocean is a massive body of water between, Asia and the Americas, which covers almost half the surface of the earth. The southern Pacific is strewn with island nations from Australia to Chile. In this post, I describe how to use R to plan your next<a0>Pacific island hopping journey. View the latest version of this code on <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Geography"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

<h2>Listing all airports</h2>

My first step was to create a list of flight connections between each of the island nations in the Pacific ocean. I am not aware of a publically available data set of international flights so unfortunately, I created the list manually by collecting route maps on <a href=""https://www.pinterest.com.au/HorizonOfReason/pacific-island-hopping/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pinterest</a> (if you do know of a fomal data set with international flights, then please leave a comment).

My manual research resulted in a list of <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Geography/PacificFlights.csv"" rel=""noopener"">international flights from or to island airports</a>. This list might not be complete, but it is a start. My Pinterest<a0>board with Pacific island airline route maps was the information source for this list.

https://www.pinterest.com.au/HorizonOfReason/pacific-island-hopping/

The first code section reads the list of airline routes and uses the ggmap package to extract their coordinates from Google maps. You will need a Google API to enable the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/geocoding-with-ggmap/"">geocoding function</a>. The data frame with airport coordinates is saved for future reference to avoid repeatedly pinging Google for the same information.

<h2>Create the map</h2>

To create a map, I modified the code to create <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/create-air-travel-route-maps/"">flight maps</a> I published in an earlier post. This code had to be changed to centre the map on the Pacific.

Mapping the Pacific ocean is problematic because the -180 and +180 degree meridians meet around the dateline.<a0>Longitudes west of the antemeridian are positive, while longitudes east are negative. The world2 data set in the borders function of the ggplot2 package is centred on the Pacific ocean. To enable plotting on this map, all negative longitudes are made positive by adding 360 degrees to them and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/mapping-antipodes/"">defining </a>the antipode.

<h2>Pacific Island Hopping</h2>

This visualisation is aesthetic and full of context, but it is not the best visualisation to solve the travel problem. This map can also be expressed as a graph with nodes (airports) and edges (routes). Once the map is represented mathematically, we can generate travel routes and begin our Pacific Island hopping.

The igraph package converts the flight<a0>list to a graph that can be analysed and plotted. The <code>shortest_path</code> function can then be used to plan routes. If I would want to travel from Auckland to Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, I have to go through Port Vila, Honiara, Port Moresby, Chuuk, Guam and then to Saipan. I am pretty sure there are quicker ways to get there, but this would be an exciting journey through the Pacific.

It is a<a0>self-describing, machine-independent data format for creating, accessing and sharing array-oriented information. The<a0>netCDF format provides spatial time-series such as meteorological or environmental data. This article shows how to visualise and analyse this data format by reviewing soil moisture data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The latest version of this code is available on my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Hydroinformatics/SoilMoisture"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub repository</a>.

<h2>Soil Moisture data</h2>

The <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/water/landscape"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Australian Bureau of Meteorology</a> publishes hydrological<a0>data in both a simple map grid and in the NetCDF format. The map grid consists of a flat text file that requires a bit of data jujitsu before it can be used. The NetCDF format is much easier to deploy as it provides a three-dimensional matrix of spatial data over time.

We are looking at the possible relationship between sewer main blockages and deep soil moisture levels. You will need to manually download this dataset from the Bureau of Meteorology website. I have not been able to scrape the website automatically. For this analysis,<a0>I use the actual <a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/water/landscape/#/sd_pct/Actual/Day/-39.00/130.40/4/Point/Separate/0/0/2017/8/21"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">deep soil moisture </a>level, aggregated monthly in NetCDF 4 format.

<h2>Reading, Extracting and Transforming the netCDF format</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ncdf4 library, developed by<a0>David W. Pierce, provides the necessary<a0>functionality to manage this data. The first step is to load the data, extract the relevant<a0>information and transform the data for visualisation and analysis. When the data is read, it essentially forms a complex list that contains the metadata and the measurements.</p>

The <code>ncvar_get</code> function extracts the data from the list. The lon, lat and dates variables are the dimensions of the moisture data. The time data is stored as the number of days since 1 January 1900. The spatial coordinates are stored in decimal degrees with 0.05-decimal degree intervals. The moisture data is a three-dimensional matrix with longitue, latitude and time as dimensions. Storing this data in this way will make it very easy to use.

<h2>Visualising the data</h2>

The first step is to check the overall data. This first code snippet extracts a matrix from the cube for 31 July 2017 and plots it. This code pipe extracts the date for the end of July 2017 and creates a data frame which is passed to ggplot for visualisation. Although I use the Tidyverse, I still need reshape2 because the gather function does not like matrices.

<h2>Analysing the data</h2>

For my analysis, I am interested in the time series of moisture data for a specific point on the map. The previous code slices the data horizontally over time. To create a time series we can pierce through the data for a specific coordinate. The purpose of this time series is to investigate the relationship between sewer main blockages and deep soil data, which can be a topic for a future post.

938,pandigital-products-euler-problem-32,Pandigital Products: Euler Problem 32,"Euler Problem 32 returns to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-29-distinct-powers/"">pandigital numbers</a>, which are numbers that contain one of each digit. Like so many of the Euler Problems, these numbers serve no practical purpose whatsoever, just like <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-4/"">palindromic products</a>, other than some entertainment value and increasing your understanding of numbers.

You can find all pandigital numbers in base-10 in the Online Encyclopedia of Integers (<a href=""https://oeis.org/A050278"" rel=""noopener"">A050278</a>). The Numberphile video explains everything you ever wanted to know about pandigital numbers but were afraid to ask.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaVMrqzb91w&amp;t=9s

<h2>Euler Problem 32 Definition</h2>

We shall say that an <em>n</em>-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to <em>n</em> exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 <d7> 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>

The <code>pandigital.9</code> function tests whether a string classifies as a pandigital number. The <code>pandigital.prod</code>
vector stores the multiplication.

The only way to solve this problem is brute force and try all multiplications but we can limit the solution space to a manageable number. The multiplication needs to have ten digits. For example, when the starting number has two digits, the second number should have three digits so that the total has four digits,<a0>e.g.:<a0>39 <d7> 186 = 7254. When the first number only has one digit, the second number needs to have four digits.

Most of my work I export to MS Word to communicate analytical results with my colleagues. For my academic work<a0>and eBooks, I prefer LaTeX to produce great typography.<a0>This article explains how to write academic articles and essays combining R Sweave and LaTeX. The article is formatted in accordance with the<a0>APA (American Psychological Association) requirements.

To illustrate the principles of using R Sweave and LaTeX, I recycled an essay about problems with body image that I wrote for a psychology course many years ago. You can find the completed paper and all the necessary files on my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Miscellaneous/BodyImage"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub repository</a>.

In another post, I have outlined how to achieve the same result using <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/using-r-with-emacs/"">Emacs and Org Mode</a> to write academic articles.

<h2>Body Image</h2>

Body image describes the way we feel about the shape of our body. The literature on this topic demonstrates that many people, especially young women, struggle with their body image.<a0>A negative body image has been strongly associated with eating disorders. Psychologists measure body image using a special scale, shown in the image below.

My paper measures the current and ideal body shape of the subject and the body shape of the most attractive other sex. The results confirm previous research which found that body dissatisfaction for females is significantly higher than for men. The research also found a mild positive correlation between age and ideal body shape for women and between age and the female body shape found most attractive by men.

<h2>R Sweave and LaTeX</h2>

The R file for this essay uses the Sweave package to integrate R code with LaTeX. The first two code chunks create<a0>a table to summarise the respondents using the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">xtable</a> package. This package creates LaTeX or HTML tables from data generated by R code.

The first lines of the code read and prepare the data, while the second set of lines creates a table in LaTeX code. The code chunk uses <code>results=tex</code> to ensure the output is interpreted as LaTeX. This approach is used in most of the other chunks.<a0>The image is created within the document and saved as a pdf file and back integrated into the document as an image with an appropriate label and caption.

1049,simulating-water-consumption,Simulating Water Consumption to Develop Analysis and Reporting,"I am currently working on developing analytics for a digital water metering project. Over the next five years, we are enabling 70,000 customer water meters with digital readers and transmitters.<a0>The data is not yet available but we don't want to wait to build reporting systems until after the data is live. The R language comes to the rescue as it has magnificent capabilities to simulate<a0>data. Simulating data is a useful technique to progress a project when data is being collected. Simulated data also helps because the outcomes of the analysis are known, which helps to validate the outcomes.

The raw data that we will eventually receive from the digital customer meters has the following basic structure:

<ul>
    <li><em>DevEUI</em>: Unique device identifier.</li>
    <li><em>Timestamp</em>: Date and time in (UTC) of the transmission.</li>
    <li><em>Cumulative count</em>: The number of revolutions the water meter<a0>makes. Each revolution<a0>is a pulse which equates to five litres of water.</li>
</ul>

Every device will send an hourly data burst which contains the cumulative meter read in pulse counts. The transmitters are set at a random offset from the whole our, to minimise the risk of congestion at the receivers. The time stamp for each read is set in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC). Using this time zone prevents issues with daylight savings. All analysis will be undertaken in the Australian Eastern (Daylight) Time zone.

This article explains how we simulated test data to assist with developing reporting and analysis. The analysis of digital metering data follows in a future post. The code and the data can be found on <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Hydroinformatics/DigitalMetering"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>. I have recently converted to using the <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tidyverse</a> for all my R coding. It has made my working life much easier and I will use it for all future posts.

<h2>Simulating water consumption</h2>

For simplicity, this simulation assumes a standard domestic diurnal curve (average daily usage pattern) for indoor water use. Diurnal curves are an important piece of information in water management. The curve shows water consumption over the course of a day, averaged over a fixed period. The example below is sourced from a journal article.<a0>This generic diurnal curve consists of 24 data points based on measured indoor water consumption, shown in the graph below.

[caption id="""" align=""aligncenter"" width=""659""]<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344914001347""><img src=""https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0921344914001347-gr8.jpg"" alt=""Simulating water consumption: diurnal curve example"" width=""659"" height=""313"" /></a> Source: Gurung et al. (2014)<a0>Smart meters for enhanced water supply network modelling and infrastructure planning.<a0>Resources, Conservation and Recycling (90), 34-50.[/caption]

This diurnal curve only includes indoor water consumption and is assumed to be independent of seasonal variation. This is not a realistic assumption, but the purpose of this simulation is not to accurately model water consumption but to provide a data set to validate the reporting and analyses.

<h2>Simulating water consumption in R</h2>

The first code snippet sets the parameters used in this simulation. The unique device identifiers (DevEUI) are simulated as six-digit random numbers. The timestamps vector consists of hourly date-time variables in UTC. For each individual transmitter, this timestamp is offset by a random time. Each transmitter is also associated with the number of people living in each house. This number is based on a Poisson distribution.

The diurnal curve is based on actual data which includes leaks as the night time use shows a consistent flow of about one litre per hour. For that reason, the figures are rounded and reduced by one litre per hour, to show a zero flow when people are usually asleep. The curve is also shifted by eleven hours because the raw data is stored in UTC.

This simulation only aims to simulate a realistic data set and not to present an accurate depiction of reality. This simulation could be enhanced by using different diurnal curves for various customer segments and to include outdoor watering, temperature dependencies and so on.

<h2>Simulating Water Consumption</h2>

A leak is defined by a constant flow through the meter, in addition to the idealised diurnal curve. A weighted binomial distribution (? = 0.1) models approximately one in ten properties with a leak. The size of the leak is derived from a random number between 10 and 50 litres per hour.

The data is stored in a matrix through a loop that cycles through each connection. The DevEUI is repeated over the simulated time period (24 times the number of days). The second variable is the timestamp plus the predetermined offset for each RTU. The meter count is defined by the cumulative sum of the diurnal flow, multiplied by the number of occupants. Each point in the diurnal deviates from the model curve by <b1>10%. Any predetermined leakage is added to each meter read over the whole period of 100 days. The hourly volumes are summed cumulatively to simulate meter reads. The flow is divided by five as each meter revolution indicate five litres.

The next code snippet simulates the digital metering data using the assumptions and parameters outlined above.

<span style=""color: #666666; font-size: 1.25rem;"">Analysing Digital Metering Data</span>

Data simulation is a good way to develop your analysis algorithms before you have real data. I have also used this technique when I was waiting for survey results during my dissertation. When the data finally arrived, I simply had to plug it into the code and finetune the code. R has great capabilities to simulate reality to help you understand the data. The ggplot package provides excellent functionality to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/geographic-bubble-chart/"">visualise water consumption</a>.

In <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/digital-water-meter-data/"">next week's article</a>, I will outline how I used R and the Tidyverse package to develop libraries to analyse digital metering data."
1125,digital-water-meter-data,Analysing Digital Water Meter Data using the Tidyverse,"In <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/simulating-water-consumption/"">last week's article</a>, I discussed how to simulate water consumption data to help develop analytics and reporting. This post describes how to create a diurnal curve from standard digital metering data. The code for this article is available on <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Hydroinformatics/DigitalMetering/Digital%20Metering%20Analysis.R"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

<h2>Data Source</h2>

The simulated data consists<a0> of three fields:

<ul>
    <li><em>DevEUI</em>: Unique identifier of the digital water meter.</li>
    <li><em>Timestamp</em><a0>in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Coordinated Universal Time</a></li>
    <li>Cumulative <em>count</em> of pulses.</li>
</ul>

All analysis is undertaken in the local Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST). The input to all functions is thus in AEST.<a0>The digital water meters send an hourly pulse at a random time within the hour. Each transmitter (RTU) uses a random offset to avoid network congestion. The digital meter counts each time the impeller makes a full turn, and for this analysis, we assume that this equates to a five-litre volume. The ratio between volume and count depends on the meter brand and type. The image below shows a typical data set for an RTU, including some missing data points.

[caption id=""attachment_1117"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""2521""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1117"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/01/consumption.png"" alt=""Simulated water consumption"" width=""2521"" height=""912"" /> Simulated water consumption (red: measured points, blue: interpolated points.[/caption]

To analyse the data we need two auxiliary functions: one to slice the data we need and one to interpolate data for the times we need it. The <a href=""https://www.tidyverse.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Tidyverse</a> heavily influences the code in this article. I like the Tidyverse way of doing things because it leads to elegant code that is easy to understand.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Initialise"">library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(magrittr)
meter_reads &lt;- read.csv(""meter_reads.csv"")
rtu &lt;- unique(meter_reads$DevEUI)
meter_reads$TimeStampUTC &lt;- as.POSIXct(meter_reads$TimeStampUTC, tz = ""UTC"")</pre>

<h2>Slicing Digital Water Metering Data</h2>

Data analysis is undertaken on slices of the complete data set. This function slices the available data by a vector of RTU ids and a timestamp<a0>range in AEST. This function adds a new timestamp variable in AEST. If no date range is provided, all available data for the selected RTUs is provided. The output of this function is a data frame (a Tibble in Tydiverse language).

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Slice the data"">slice_reads &lt;- function(rtus, dates = range(meter_reads$TimeStampUTC)) {
    filter(meter_reads, DevEUI %in% rtus) %&gt;%
    mutate(TimeStampAEST = as.POSIXct(format(TimeStampUTC, tz = ""Australia/Melbourne""))) %&gt;%
    filter(TimeStampAEST &gt;= as.POSIXct(dates[1]) &amp;
           TimeStampAEST &lt;= as.POSIXct(dates[2])) %&gt;%
    arrange(DevEUI, TimeStampAEST)
}</pre>

<h2>Interpolation of Meter Reads</h2>

This function interpolates the cumulative counts for a series of RTUs over a vector of timestamps in AEST. The function creates a list to store the results for each RTU, interpolates the data using the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/approxfun.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">approx function</a> and then flattens the list back to a data frame. The interpolation function contains a different type of pipe because of the approx for interpolation function does not take a data argument. The <code>%$%</code> pipe from the Magrittr<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/README.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> package</a> solves that problem.

The output is a data frame with DevEUI, the timestamp in AEST and the interpolated cumulative count. The image above shows the counts for two meters over two days an the graph superimposes an interpolated point over the raw data.

With these two auxiliary functions, we can start analysing the data.

<h2>Daily Consumption</h2>

Daily consumption for each connection is a critical metric in managing water resources and billing customers.<a0>The daily consumption of any water connection is defined by the difference between the cumulative counts at midnight. The interpolation function makes it easy to determine daily consumption. This function interpolates the midnight reads for each of the RTUs over the period, starting the previous day. The output of the function is a data frame that can be piped into the plotting function to visualise the data. When you group the data by date, you can also determine the total consumption over a group of services.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Daily consumption"">daily_consumption &lt;- function(rtus, dates) {

<h2>Diurnal Curves</h2>

The diurnal curve is one of the most important pieces of information used in the design of water supply systems. This curve shows the usage of one or more services for each hour in the day. This curve is a reflection of human behaviour, as we use most water in the morning and the evenings.

This function slices data for a vector of RTUs over a period and then plots the average diurnal curve. The data is obtained by interpolating the cumulative counts for each whole hour in the period. The function then calculates the flow in litres per hour and visualises the minimum, mean and maximum value.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""Diurnal curve"">plot_diurnal_connections &lt;- function(rtus, dates) {

}

Boxplots are also an informative way to visualise this curve. This method provides more statistical information on one page, and the ggplot function performs the statistical analysis.

1129,plotting-mobius-strip,Topological Tomfoolery in R: Plotting a M<f6>bius Strip,"Geometry is an entertaining branch of mathematics. Topology is, according to <a href=""http://www.pickover.com/"">Clifford Pickover</a>, the ""silly putty of mathematics"". This branch of maths studies the transformation of shapes, knots and other complex geometry problems.<a0> One of the most famous topics in topology is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip"" rel=""noopener"">M<f6>bius strip</a>. This shape has some unusual properties which have inspired many artists, inventors, mathematicians and magicians.

You can make a M<f6>bius strip by taking a strip of paper, giving it one twist and glue the ends together to form a loop. If you now cut this strip lengthwise in half, you don't end-up with two separate strips, but with one long one.

https://youtu.be/wKV0GYvR2X8

The M<f6>bius strip can also be described with the following parametric equations (where $latex 0 \leq u \leq 2\pi $, $latex -1 \leq v \leq 1 $ and $latex R $ is the radius of the loop):

$latex x(u,v)= \left(R+\frac{v}{2} \cos \frac{u}{2}\right)\cos u $
$latex y(u,v)= \left(R+\frac{v}{2} \cos\frac{u}{2}\right)\sin u $
$latex z(u,v)= \frac{v}{2}\sin \frac{u}{2} $

The <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/638225/understanding-the-equation-of-a-m%C3%B6bius-strip"" rel=""noopener"">mathematics of this set of parametric equations</a> is not as compex as it looks. $latex R $ is the radius of the ring, $latex u $ is the polar angle of each point and $latex v $ indicates the width of the strip. The polar angle $latex u/2 $ indicates the number of half twists. To make the ring twist twice, change the anlge to $latex u $.

For my data science day job, I have to visualise some three-dimensional spaces, so I thought I best learn how to do this by visualising a M<f6>bis strip, using these three equations.

<h2>Plotting a M<f6>bius Strip</h2>

The <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/vignettes/rgl.html"" rel=""noopener"">RGL package</a> provides the perfect functionality for plotting M<f6>bius strips. This package produces interactive three-dimensional plots that you can zoom and rotate. This package has many options to change lighting, colours, shininess<a0>and so on. The code to create for plotting a M<f6>bius strip is straightforward.

The first section defines the parameters and converts the $latex u $ and $latex v $ sequences to a mesh (from the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plot3D/index.html"">plot3D package</a>). This function creates two matrices with every possible combination of $latex u $ and $Latex v $ which are used to calculate the $latex x, y, z $ points.

The last three lines define a 3D window with a white background and plot the 3D surface in blue. You can explore the figure with your mouse by zooming and rotating it. Parametric equations can be a bit of fun, play with the formula to change the shape and see what happens. You can view the code below, or find the latest version on <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Miscellaneous/moebius.R"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

We can take it to the next level by plotting a three-dimensional M<f6>bius strip, or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle"">Klein Bottle</a>. The parametric equations for the bottle are mind boggling:

$latex x(u,v) = -\frac{2}{15} \cos u (3 \cos{v}-30 \sin{u}+90 \cos^4{u} \sin{u} -60 \cos^6{u} \sin{u} +5 \cos{u} \cos{v} \sin{u}) $

$latex y(u,v) = -\frac{1}{15} \sin u (3 \cos{v}-3 \cos^2{u} \cos{v}-48 \cos^4{u} \cos{v} + 48 \cos^6{u} \cos{v} - 60 \sin{u}+5 \cos{u} \cos{v} \sin{u}-5 \cos^3{u} \cos{v} \sin{u}-80 \cos^5{u} \cos{v} \sin{u}+80 \cos^7{u} \cos{v} \sin{u}) $

$latex z(u,v) = \frac{2}{15} (3+5 \cos{u} \sin{u}) \sin{v} $

Where: $latex 0 \leq u \leq \pi$ and $latex 0 \leq v \leq 2\leq $.

The code to visualise this bottle is essentially the same, just more complex equations.

The RGL package has some excellent facilities to visualise<a0>three-dimensional objects, far beyond simple strips. I am still learning and am working toward using it to visualise bathymetric surveys of water reservoirs. M<f6>bius strips are, however, a lot more fun.

Despite the fact that high-quality drinking water is almost freely available, the consumption of bottled water is increasing every year. Bottled water companies use sophisticated marketing strategies, while water utilities are mostly passive providers of public service. Australian marketing expert Russell Howcroft even called water utilities ""lazy marketers"". Can we use data science to find out more about how people feel about tap water and learn about the reasons behind this loss in trust in the municipal water supply?

This tap water sentiment analysis estimates the attitudes people have towards tap water by analysing tweets. This article explains how to examine tweets about tap water using the R language for statistical computing and the <a href=""https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html"" rel=""noopener"">Tidytext package</a>. The most recent version of the code and the raw data set used in this analysis can be viewed on my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Hydroinformatics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub page</a>.

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>

Sentiment analysis is a suitable technique to get a feel for the the perception a group of people has about a certain topic. Traditionaly, this ould require surveys. This method is problematic because it creates an artificial environment where the respondent often answers to meet the perceived expectations of the survey or customers exaggerate to get their point across. Using sentiment analysis of ego-documents written by consumers can overcome these problems. Ego-documents, i.e. forms of personal writing, are a more direct way to find out what consumers think, but they are not easy to obtain and analyse.

With the advent of social media, access to ego documents has become much simpler and many tools exist to collect and interpret this data. Using ego-documents brings you closer to the consumer than can be possible with surveys or focus groups. One medium gaining popularity with market researchers is <a title=""Twitter"" href=""http://twitter.com/"">Twitter</a>.

<h2>Tap Water Sentiment Analysis</h2>

Each tweet that contains the words ""tap water"" contains a message about the attitude the author has towards that topic. Each text expresses a sentiment about the topic it describes. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"" rel=""noopener"">Sentiment analysis</a> is a data science technique that extracts subjective information from a text. The basic method compares a string of words with a set of words with<a0>calibrated<a0>sentiments. These calibrated sets are created by asking many people how they feel about a certain word. For example, the word ""stink"" expresses a negative sentiment, while the word ""nice"" would be a positive sentiment.

This tap water sentiment analysis consists of three steps. The first step extracts 1000 tweets that contain the words ""tap water"" from Twitter. The second step cleans the data, and the third step undertakes the analysis visualises the results.

<h2>Extracting tweets using the<a0>TwitteR<a0>package</h2>

The <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">TwitteR package</a> by Geoff Gentry makes it very easy to retrieve tweets using search criteria. You will need to create an API on Twitter to receive the keys and tokens. In the code below, the actual values have been removed. Follow the instructions in <a href=""https://www.r-bloggers.com/setting-up-the-twitter-r-package-for-text-analytics/"" rel=""noopener"">this article</a> to obtain these codes for yourself. This code snippet calls a private file to load the API codes, extracts the tweets and creates a data frame with a tweet id number and its text.

Unfortunately, this left less than 300 original tweets in the corpus.

<h2>Sentiment analysis with Tidytext</h2>

Text analysis can be a powerful tool to help to analyse large amounts of text. The R language has an extensive range of packages to help you undertake such a task.<a0>The <a href=""https://www.tidytextmining.com/"">Tidytext</a> package extends the <a href=""http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html"" rel=""noopener"">Tidy Data</a> logic promoted by Hadley Wickham and his Tidyverse software collection.

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>

The first step in cleaning the data is to create unigrams, which involves splitting the tweets into individual words that can be analysed. The first step is to look at which words are most commonly used in the tap water tweets and visualise the result.

The most common words related to drinking the water and to bottled water, which makes sense. Also the recent issues in Kentucky feature in this list.

<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>

The Tidytext package contains three lexicons of thousands of single English words (unigrams) that were manually assessed for their sentiment.<a0>The principle of the sentiment analysis is to compare the words in the text with the words in the lexicon and analyse the results. For example, the statement: ""This tap water tastes horrible"" has a sentiment score of -3 in the AFFIN system by<a0><a href=""http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010"">Finn <c5>rup Nielsen</a><a0>due to the word ""horrible"". In this analysis, I have used the ""bing"" method published by <a href=""https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Liu et al. in 2005</a>.

This method is certainly not fool proof as words with the same spelling can mean different things. For example, the phrase: ""This tap water contains too much lead"" will be assess as a positive sentiment because the verb lead is seen as positive. The noun lead has no sentiment as it depends on context.

This tap water sentiment analysis shows that two-thirds of the words that express a sentiment were negative. The most common negative words were ""smells"" and ""scared"". This<a0>analysis is not a positive result for water utilities. Unfortunately, most tweets were not spatially located so I couldn't determine the origin of the sentiment.

Sentiment analysis is an interesting explorative technique, but it should not be interpreted as absolute truth. This method is not able to detect sarcasm or irony, and words don't always have the same meaning as described in the dictionary.

The important message for water utilities is that they need to start taking the aesthetic properties of tap water as serious as the health parameters. A lack of trust will drive consumers to bottled water, or less healthy alternatives such as soft drinks are alternative water sources.

The string of numbers that form the decimals of Pi might seem random, but they are of course perfectly predictable and calculable.<a0></span>Their apparent randomness can create artful visualisations.

This article discusses some approximations of Pi using the R language and visualises the results. The video below is an ode to the aesthetic beauty of the digits of Pi by Numberphile.

<h2>Approximations of Pi</h2>

My favourite approximation of Pi has served me well through the early part of my engineering career. When using calculators that did not have a button for $latex \pi $, I used <code>22/7</code>. It is only accurate to two decimals, but that is more than enough for dredging projects.

The base R language can provide 22 decimals of Pi using <code>options(digits = 22)</code>.<a0>If you need more accuracy, then the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpfr/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">MPFR package</a> in R provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computations. The <code>Const</code> function can compute Pi to a high level of precision with thousands of digits.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true "" title=""High-precision Pi"">library(rmpfr)
pi_mpfr &lt;- Const(""pi"", prec = 200000)</pre>

There are also more creative ways to determine the number Pi using Monte Carlo simulations. Imagine you are terribly bored, sitting inside a room with floorboards. You decide to take a match with length<a0>$latex l&amp;s=1$ and the floorboards are $latex t&amp;s=1$ wide. The needle is half the length of the width of the floorboards ($latex t/l = 2&amp;s=1$). You drop the matchstick randomly for about ten million times ($latex n=10,000,000&amp;s=1$) and you record every time the needle crosses the groove of one of the boards ($latex o&amp;s=1$). This thought experiment is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Buffon's needle</a>. The number Pi can be approximated by:

$latex \pi \approx \frac{c \cdot l}{o \cdot t} &amp;s=3$

This bit of code simulates dropping the needle ten million times, which gives an estimated value of $latex \pi \approx 3.143096 &amp;s=1$. You would have to be extremely bored to throw a needle that many times to only achieve ccuracy to two decimals!

<h2>Visualising the approximations of Pi</h2>

In 1888, the John Venn, inventor of the eponymous Venn diagram, wanted to visualise the apparent randomness of the digits of Pi.<a0>He obtained the first 707 digits of Pi from amateur mathematician William Shanks. Unfortunately, only the first 527 decimals of Pi were correct but this was only discovered in 1944. Venn assigned a compass point to the digits 0 to 7 and then drew lines to show the path indicated by each digit, ignoring the digits 8 and 9.

Running through the values of Pi this way produces a line that snakes its way through the graph. When you use random numbers with the same method, the graph looks very similar. In this case, I have downloaded the digits of Pi from the <em>On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</em> (Nr. <a href=""http://oeis.org/A000796"" rel=""noopener"">A000796</a>).

345,qualitative-data-science,Qualitative Data Science: Using RQDA to analyse interviews,"Qualitative data science sounds like a contradiction in terms. Data scientists generally solve problems using numerical solutions. Even the analysis of text is reduced to a numerical problem using Markov chains, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/rvest-and-tidytext/"">topic analysis</a>, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-sentiment-analysis/"">sentiment analysis</a> and other mathematical tools.

Scientists and professionals consider numerical methods the gold standard of analysis. There is, however, a price to pay when relying on numbers alone. Numerical analysis reduces the complexity of the social world. When analysing people, numbers present an illusion of precision and accuracy.<a0>Giving primacy to quantitative research in the social sciences comes at a high price. The dynamics of reality are reduced to statistics, losing the narrative of the people that the research aims to understand.

Being both an engineer and a social scientist, I acknowledge the importance of both numerical and qualitative methods. My dissertation used a mixed-method approach to review the relationship between employee behaviour and customer perception in water utilities. This article introduces some aspects of qualitative data science with an example from my dissertation.

In this article, I show how I analysed data from interviews using both quantitative and qualitative methods and demonstrate why qualitative data science is better to understand text than numerical methods. The most recent version of the code is available on my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Hydroinformatics/Macromarketing"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub repository</a>. Unfortunately, I cannot share the data set as this contains personally identifying data.

<h2>Qualitative Data Science</h2>

The often celebrated artificial intelligence of machine learning is impressive but does not come close to human intelligence and ability to understand the world. Many data scientists are working on automated text analysis to solve this issue (the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/"" rel=""noopener"">topicmodels</a> package is an example of such an attempt).<a0>These efforts are impressive, but even the smartest text analysis algorithm is not able to derive <em>meaning</em> from text. To fully embrace all aspects of data science we need to be able to methodically undertake <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research"" rel=""noopener"">qualitative<a0>data analysis</a>.

The capabilities of R in numerical analysis are impressive, but it can also assist with Qualitative Data<a0>Analysis (QDA). Huang Ronggui from Hong Kong developed the <a href=""http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/"" rel=""noopener"">RQDA package</a> to analyse texts in R. RQDA assists with qualitative data analysis using a GUI front-end to analyse collections texts. The video below contains a complete course in using this software. Below the video, I share an example from my dissertation which compares qualitative and quantitative methods for analysing text.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66CB2FF65368715C&amp;feature=plcp

For my dissertation about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">water utility marketing</a>, I interviewed seven people from various organisations. The purpose of these interviews was to learn about the value proposition for water utilities. The data consists of the transcripts of six interviews which I manually coded using RQDA. For reasons of agreed anonymity, I cannot provide the raw data file of the interviews through GitHub.

<h2>Numerical Text Analysis</h2>

Word clouds are a popular method for exploratory analysis of texts.<a0>The wordcloud is created with the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">text mining</a> and wordcloud packages. The transcribed interviews are converted to a text corpus (the native format for the tm package) and whitespace, punctuation etc is removed. This code snippet opens the RQDA file and extracts the texts from the database. RQDA stores all text in an SQLite database and the package provides a query command to extract data.

[caption id=""attachment_1255"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""932""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-1255"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/05/wordcloud.png"" alt="""" width=""932"" height=""779"" /> Word cloud of interview transcripts[/caption]

This word cloud makes it clear that the interviews are about water businesses and customers, which is a pretty obvious statement. The interviews are also about the opinion of the interviewees (think). While the word cloud is aesthetically pleasing and provides a quick snapshot of the content of the texts, they cannot inform us about their meaning.

Topic modelling is a more advanced method to extract information from the text by assessing the proximity of words to each other. The <a href=""https://eight2late.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/a-gentle-introduction-to-topic-modeling-using-r/"" rel=""noopener"">topic modelling</a> package provides functions to perform this analysis. I am not an expert in this field and simply followed basic steps using default settings with four topics.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Topic Models"">dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(interviews)
dtm &lt;- removeSparseTerms(dtm, 0.99)
ldaOut &lt;-LDA(dtm, k = 4)
terms(ldaOut,6)</pre>

This code converts the corpus created earlier into a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix"" rel=""noopener"">Document-Term Matrix</a>, which is a matrix of words and documents (the interviews) and the frequency at which each of these words occurs. The LDA function applies a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation"" rel=""noopener"">Latent Dietrich Allocation</a> to the matrix to define the topics. The variable k defines the number of anticipated topics. An LDA is similar to clustering in multivariate data. The final output is a table with six words for each topic.

[table id=2 /]

This table does not tell me much at all about what was discussed in the interviews. Perhaps it is the frequent use of the word ""water"" or ""think""<97>I did ask people their opinion about water-related issues. To make this analysis more meaningful, I could perhaps manually remove the words water, yeah, and so on. This introduces bias in the analysis and reduces the reliability of the topic analysis because I would be interfering with the text.

Numerical text analysis sees a text as a bag of words instead of a set of meaningful words. It seems that any automated text mining needs a lot of manual cleaning to derive anything meaningful. This excursion shows that automated text analysis is not a sure-fire way to analyse the meaning of a collection of words. After a lot of trial and error to try to make this work, I decided to go back to my roots of qualitative analysis using RQDA as my tool.

<h2>Qualitative Data Science Using RQDA</h2>

To use RQDA for qualitative data science, you first need to manually analyse each text and assign codes (topics) to parts of the text. The image below shows a question and answer and how it was coded. All marked text is blue, and the codes are shown between markers. Coding a text is an iterative process that aims to extract meaning from a text. The advantage of this method compared to numerical analysis is that the researcher injects meaning into the analysis. The disadvantage is that the analysis will always be biased, which in the social sciences is unavoidable. My list of topics was based on words that appear in a marketing dictionary so that I analysed the interviews from that perspective.

My first step was to look at the occurrence of codes (themes) in each of the interviews.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Open coding"">## Load and transform data
codings &lt;- getCodingTable()[,4:5]
categories &lt;- RQDAQuery(""SELECT filecat.name AS category, source.name AS filename 
                         FROM treefile, filecat, source 
                         WHERE treefile.catid=filecat.catid AND treefile.fid=source.id AND treefile.status=1"")
codings &lt;- merge(codings, categories, all.y = TRUE)
head(codings)

## Open coding
reorder_size &lt;- function(x) {
    factor(x, levels = names(sort(table(x))))
}
ggplot(codings, aes(reorder_size(codename), fill=category)) + geom_bar(stat=""count"") + 
    facet_grid(~filename) + coord_flip() + 
    theme(legend.position=""bottom"", legend.title=element_blank()) + 
    ylab(""Code frequency in interviews"") + xlab(""Code"")</pre>

The code uses an internal RQDA function <em>getCodingTable</em> to obtain the primary data. The <em>RQDAQuery</em> function provides more flexibility and can be used to build more complex queries of the data. You can view the structure of the RQDA database using the <em>RQDATables</em> function.

[caption id=""attachment_388"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1571""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-388"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2017/02/interviewcode.png"" alt=""Occurrence of themes from six interviews."" width=""1571"" height=""1756"" /> The occurrence of themes from six interviews.[/caption]

This bar chart helps to explore the topics that interviewees discussed, but it does not help to understand how these topic relate to each other. This method provides a better view than the 'bag of words' approach because the text has been given meaning.

RQDA provides a facility to assign each code to a code category. This structure can be visualised using a network. The network is visualised using the igraph package, and the graph shows how codes relate to each other.

Qualitative data analysis can create value from a text by interpreting it from a given perspective. This article is not even an introduction to the science and art of qualitative data science. I hope it invites you to explore RQDA and similar tools.

1107,euler-problem-144,Laser Beams and Elliptical Billiards: Euler Problem 144,"Euler problem 144 has been one of the most fun to solve. The underlying problem is the pathway of the reflection of a laser inside an ellipse-shaped mirror. Before I delve into this problem, I like to share this delightful video from <a href=""http://www.numberphile.com/"" rel=""noopener"">Numberphile</a> in which Alex Bellos demonstrates an elliptical billiards table. The billiards problem is mathematically equivalent to the laser problem. The reflection rule optics is the same as the bouncing rule in mechanics, but instead of using light, we use a billiard ball.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHCuXN2F3I

This article outlines my solution to Euler problem 104 and simulates the elliptical pool table in the R language. You can find the code on the <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/ProjectEuler/problem144.R"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub repository</a> for this website.

<h2>Euler Problem 144 Definition</h2>

In laser physics, a <93>white cell<94> is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.

The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation $latex 4x^2 + y^2= 100$.<a0>The section corresponding to $latex -0.01 \leq \times \leq +0.01$ at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

<img class=""size-full aligncenter"" src=""https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p144_1.gif"" alt=""Euler Problem 144"" width=""268"" height=""240"" />

The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6). Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection ""angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection."" That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence. In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce. The slope $latex m$ of the tangent line at any point $latex (x,y)$ of the given ellipse is<a0>$latex m = -4x/y$. The normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.

How many times does the beam hit the internal surface of the white cell before exiting?

<h2>Proposed Solution to Euler Problem 144</h2>

The first step was to rewrite the equation to use functions to generalise the problem. The general Cartesian equation for an ellipse is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, a &lt; b$</p>

The length of the axes for this problem is $latex a =5$ and $latex b = 10$. While the Project Euler description gives the formula for the slope of the tangent to the ellipse, I have generalised the code to reuse it for the elliptical billiards table. The slope of the tangent to an ellipse at point $latex (x,y)$ is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex m=-\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}$</p>

This first code snippet defines functions to draw an ellipse and calculate the bouncing angle. The last part of the code bounces the laser inside the cell until it exits through the top.

I sourced the formula to find the intersection between a line and an ellipse from <a href=""http://www.ambrsoft.com/TrigoCalc/Circles2/Ellipse/EllipseLine.htm"" rel=""noopener"">Ambrsoft</a>. The equation has two possible solutions, one of which is the same as the original point.

<h2>Elliptical Pool Table</h2>

We can use the solution to Euler problem 144 to play billiards on an elliptical billiards table. To close the article, we return to the elliptical pool table demonstrated by Alex Bellos. This code draws the pool table to the dimensions mentioned in the video. We know that the table has an eccentricity of $latex e = 0.43$ and a long axis of $latex a = 130$ cm. The code defines the short axis ($latex b$) and the distance of the focal points from the centre.

The code selects a random starting point and angle of the shot. The code first determines whether the line passes through the pocket. If this is not the case, the algorithm then finds the place where the ball hits and keeps bouncing it until it falls into the pocket or the ball bounces 100 times.

Elliptical billiard tables have four possible outcomes. Any ball the pass through a focal point will fall into the pocket, ending the simulation. Any ball that passes outside the focal points will bounce around, and the combined trajectories form an ellipse. When the ball moves between the foci, the result is a hyperbola. Lastly, there are some unique circumstances which result in a regular polygon.

If simulations are not enough for you, then head over to the <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Elliptical-Pool-Table/"" rel=""noopener"">Instructables</a> website to find out how you can construct an<a0>elliptical billiards table. There is even a patent for an <a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US5226644"" rel=""noopener"">elliptical pocket billiard table</a>, with the pockets at the edge.

1342,rvest-and-tidytext,Defining Marketing with the Rvest and Tidytext Packages,"I am preparing to facilitate another session of the marketing course for the <a href=""https://www.latrobe.edu.au/courses/mba"" rel=""noopener"">La Trobe University MBA</a>. The first lecture delves into the definition of marketing. Like most other social phenomena, marketing is tough to define. Definitions of social constructs often rely on the perspective taken by the person or group writing the definition. As such, definitions also change over time. While a few decades ago, definitions of marketing revolved around sales and advertising, <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190201101014/https://www.ama.org/AboutAMA/Pages/Definition-of-Marketing.aspx"" rel=""noopener"">contemporary definitions</a> are more holistic and reference creating value.

Heidi Cohen wrote a blog post where she collated <a href=""https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/"" rel=""noopener"">72 definitions of marketing</a>. So rather than arguing over which definition is the best, why not use all definitions simultaneously? This article attempts to define a new definition of marketing, using a data science approach. We can use the R language to scrape the 72 definitions from Heidi's website and attempt text analysis to extract the essence of marketing from this data set.

I have mentioned in a previous post about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/qualitative-data-science/"">qualitative data science</a> that automated text analysis is not always a<a0>useful<a0>method to extract meaning from a text. I decided to delve a little deeper into automated text analysis to see if we find out anything useful about marketing using the rvest and tidytext packages.

The presentation below shows the slides I use in my introductory lecture into marketing. The code and analyses are shown below the slideshow. You can download the most recent version of the code from my <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Marketing"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a> Repository.

<h2>Scraping text with Rvest</h2>

Web scraping is a technique to download data from websites where this data is not available as a clean data source. Web scraping starts with downloading the HTML code from the website and the filtering the wanted text from this file. The <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/"" rel=""noopener"">rvest package</a> makes this process very easy.

The code for this article uses a pipe (<code>%&gt;%</code>) with three rvest commands. The first step is to download the wanted html code from the web using the <code>read_html</code> function. The output of this function is piped to the <code>html_nodes</code> function, which does all the hard work. In this case, the code picks all lines of text that are embedded in an ordered list. You can use the <a href=""http://selectorgadget.com/"" rel=""noopener"">SelectorGadget</a> to target the text you like to scrape. The last scraping step cleans the text by piping the output of the previous commands to the <code>html_text</code> function.

The result of the scraping process is converted to a <a href=""https://tibble.tidyverse.org/"" rel=""noopener"">Tibble</a>, which is a type of data frame used in the Tidyverse. The definition number is added to the data, and the Tibble is converted to the format required by the Tidytext package. The resulting data frame is much longer than the 72 definitions because there are other lists on the page. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to filter only the 72 definitions.

    as_data_frame() %&gt;%
    mutate(No = 1:nrow(.)) %&gt;%
    select(No, Definition = value)</pre>

<h2>Tidying the Text</h2>

The <a href=""https://www.tidytextmining.com/"" rel=""noopener"">Tidytext</a> package extends the <a href=""http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html"" rel=""noopener"">tidy data</a> philosophy to a text. In this approach to text analysis, a corpus consists of a data frame where each word is a separate item. The code snippet below takes the first 72 rows, and the <code>unnest_tokens</code> function extracts each word from the 72 definitions. This function can also extract ngrams and other word groups from the text. The Tidytext package is an extremely versatile piece of software which goes far beyond the scope of this article. Julia Silge and David Robinson have written a book about <a href=""https://www.tidytextmining.com/"" rel=""noopener"">text mining</a> using this package, which provides a very clear introduction to the craft of analysing text.

The last section of the pipe removes the trailing ""s"" from each word to convert plurals into single words. The mutate function in the Tidyverse creates or recreates a new variable in a data frame.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Bag of words"">## bag of words
def_words &lt;- definitions[1:72, ] %&gt;%
    unnest_tokens(word, Definition) %&gt;%
    mutate(word = gsub(""s$"", """", word))</pre>

This section creates a data frame with two variables. The No variable indicates the definition number (1<96>72) and the word variable is a word within the definition. The order of the words is preserved in the row name. To check the data frame you can run <code>unique(def_words$No[which(def_words$word == ""marketing"")])</code>. This line finds all definition numbers with the word ""marketing"", wich results, as expected, in the number 1 to 72.

<h2>Using Rvest and Tidytext to define marketing</h2>

We can now proceed to analyse the definitions scraped from the website with Rvest and cleaned with Tidytext. The first step is to create a word cloud, which is a popular way to visualise word frequencies. This code creates a data frame for each unique word, excluding the word marketing itself, and uses the wordcloud package to visualise the fifty most common words.

[caption id=""attachment_7032"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1121""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-7032"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/08/marketingcloud.png"" alt=""72 Definitions of marketing summarised."" width=""1121"" height=""1090"" /> 72 Definitions of marketing summarised.[/caption]

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Word frequencies"">word_freq &lt;- def_words %&gt;%
    anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%
    count(word) %&gt;%
    filter(!(word %in%
             c(""marketing"", ""vice"", ""president"", ""chief"", ""executive"", ""<92>"")))

pdf(""marketingcloud.pdf"")
word_freq %&gt;%
    with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 50, rot.per = .5,
                   colors = rev(lm_palette)))
dev.off()

word_freq %&gt;%
    top_n(10) %&gt;%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(word, n)) + geom_col(fill = lm_palette[2]) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(text = element_text(size=20))</pre>

While a word cloud is indeed a pretty way to visualise the bag of words in a text, it is not the most useful way to get the reader to understand the data. The words are jumbled, and the reader needs to search for meaning. A better way to visualise word frequencies is a bar chart. This code takes the data frame created in the previous snippet, determines the top ten occurring words. The mutate statement reorders to factor levels so that the words are plotted in order.

[caption id=""attachment_6796"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""2096""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-6796"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/05/marketingtop10words.png"" alt=""Top ten words in marketing definitions."" width=""2096"" height=""2097"" /> Top ten words in marketing definitions.[/caption]

A first look at the word cloud and bar chart suggests that marketing is about customers and products and services. Marketing is a process that includes branding and communication. This definition is simplistic but functional.

<h2>Topic Modeling using Tidytext</h2>

Word frequencies are a weak method to analyse text because it interprets each word as a solitary unit. Topic modelling is a more advanced method that examines the relationships between words, i.e. the distance between them. The first step is to create a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix"" rel=""noopener"">Document-Term Matrix</a>, which is a matrix that indicates how often a word appears in a text.<a0> As each of the 72 texts are very short, I decided to treat the collection of definitions as one text about marketing. The cast_dtm function converts the data frame to a Document-Term Matrix.

The following pipe determines the top words in the topics. Just like k-means clustering, the analyst needs to choose the number of topics before analysing the text. In this case, I have opted for four topics. The code determines the contribution of each word to the four topics and selects the five most common words in each topic. The faceted bar chart shows each of the words in the four topics.

[caption id=""attachment_6797"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""2100""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-6797"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/05/MarketingTopics.png"" alt=""Topic modelling 72 definitions of marketing"" width=""2100"" height=""2100"" /> Topic modelling 72 definitions of marketing[/caption]

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Topic models"">marketing_dtm &lt;- word_freq %&gt;%
    mutate(doc = 1) %&gt;%
    cast_dtm(doc, word, n)

marketing_lda &lt;- LDA(marketing_dtm, k = 4) %&gt;%
    tidy(matrix = ""beta"") %&gt;%
    group_by(topic) %&gt;%
    top_n(5, beta) %&gt;%
    ungroup() %&gt;%
    arrange(topic, -beta)

marketing_lda %&gt;%
    mutate(term = reorder(term, beta)) %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(term, beta, fill = factor(topic))) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = lm_palette[-1:-2]) + 
       facet_wrap(~topic, scales = ""free"") +
       coord_flip() +
       theme(text = element_text(size = 20))</pre>

This example also does not tell me much more about what marketing is, other than giving a slightly more sophisticated version of the word frequency charts. This chart shows me that marketing is about customers that enjoy a service and a product. Perhaps the original definitions are not distinctive enough to be separated from each other.

This article is only a weak summary of the great work by Julia Silge who co-authored the Tidytext package. The video below provides a comprehensive introduction to topic modelling.

<h2>What have we learnt?</h2>

This excursion into text analysis using rvest and Tidytext shows that data science can help us to make some sense out of an unread text. If I did not know what this page was about, then perhaps this analysis would enlighten me. This kind of analysis can assist us in wading through to large amounts of text to select the ones we want to read. I am still not convinced that this type of analysis will provide any knowledge beyond what can be obtained from actually reading and engaging with a text.

Although I am a data scientist and want to maximise the use of code in analysing data, I am very much in favour of developing human intelligence before we worry about the artificial kind."

<p>A few years ago I ditched the spreadsheet in favour of writing code in R. During the process I learnt a valuable lesson: The steeper the learning curve, the larger the reward. My time invested in learning R has paid off in spades, and I now use the R language for all my numerical and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/qualitative-data-science/"">qualitative analysis</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most data scientists solve data problems with the R language using the <a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener"">RStudio</a> IDE, a free and open-source Integrated Development Environment. Although RStudio is a great product, like all other software products, it's functionality is limited to doing one thing well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since last year I use <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"" rel=""noopener"">Emacs</a> and once again the rule that a steep learning curve has a valuable reward has come true. Emacs is the Swiss army chainsaw of productivity, the ultimate killer app and also one of the <a href=""https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsHistory"" rel=""noopener"">oldest</a> active pieces of software. Although it might seem that newer is better when it comes to software, Emacs has continuously evolved. The power of Emacs is its extensive functionality and virtually infinite customisability. Almost ninety per cent of all my computing activity now takes place within Emacs. I use it to write notes, manage my action lists, write e-mails, articles, books. The <a href=""https://orgmode.org/"" rel=""noopener"">Org Mode</a> package in Emacs is the working horse that undertakes many of these functions. Since recently also to write R code in Emacs and ESS.</p>

<h2>Using R with Emacs and ESS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advantage of using Emacs over RStudio is that I can seamlessly switch between my notes, to-do lists, calendars and so on, while also developing code. There is no need to install, maintain and master multiple applications as Emacs cover almost all my computing needs. Just like R, Emacs includes thousands of packages that extend its functionality far beyond what one would expect from a text editor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The disadvantage of Emacs compared to RStudio is that it is not as pretty and the screen more resembles an angry fruit salad than a slick material design. The image above shows my screen when I translated a paper about body image research into Org Mode with embedded R code. A temporary disadvantage is that there is a bit of preparation is required to enable coding in Emacs, but that is only a temporary hurdle and adds to the learning curve.</p>

<h2>Using R with Emacs and ESS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To start using R with Emacs type <code>M-x R RET</code>. ESS will ask to nominate a working directory and opens a new buffer with the name <code>*R*</code>. You can now use the R console to write code. You can open multiple instances of the R console with different working directories and environment, just like projects in RStudio.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Emacs now recognises any file with the .R extension as being written in the R language. This functionality is a so-called Emacs major mode, which is the essential functionality of Emacs. A <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Modes.html"" rel=""noopener"">major mode</a> defines how Emacs processes a file is managed, whether it is an R file, an Org Mode file and so on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One bit of useful information is that the underscore key is mapped to the <code>&lt;-</code> assignment<a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html"" rel=""noopener""> operator</a>. If you need an underscore, you need to type it twice in a row. This functionality can be annoying when you are an avid user of ggplot. The <a href=""https://github.com/mattfidler/ess-smart-underscore.el"" rel=""noopener"">ess-smart-underscore</a> package solves this issue by extending the functionality of ESS. You can install this package in the same way you installed ESS itself. To enable it, add <code>(require 'ess-smart-underscore)</code> to your init file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To write in a source file, you can create a .R file by typing <code>C-x C-f</code> (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Visiting.html"" rel=""noopener"">find-file</a> function). Type the filename to create a new file, or when it already exists, open the file. You can now start writing R code as you would in any other editor. As soon as you evaluate code for the first time in a session, ESS will ask you what the starting project directory is, which is defaulted to the folder that your .R file is in. To evaluate the whole buffer, use C-c B, to evaluate a section use C-c c and to evaluate a line press M-RET.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To show the source file and the R console next to each other, type <code>C-x 3</code> to <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Split-Window.html"" rel=""noopener"">split your window</a> to show two buffers. You can then use C-x b to select the other buffer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A disadvantage of using R in ESS is that there is no simple way to integrate plot outputs into the Emacs window. When I am iteratively working on visualisation, I save it to a file and open it in a separate buffer, as shown in the screendump.</p>

<h2>Using R with Emacs and ESS to Write an Academic Paper</h2>

<p>Org Mode is the most popular extension of Emacs and is precompiled with current versions of the software. Org Mode is an extremely versatile text editing extension. I use it to manage my projects using a calendar and To-Do lists, I write notes, write books an articles. I have translated an article I previously wrote <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/r-sweave-and-latex/"">LaTeX and Sweave</a> to Org Mode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Org Mode works very well with <a href=""https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-export.html"" rel=""noopener"">LaTeX</a>. You will need to write some code into your init file to set a template, after which writing LaTeX code is a breeze. The <a href=""https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/"" rel=""noopener"">Org Babel</a> package functions as an interface between Org Mode and R. Perhaps explaining this file in detail is a topic for a future post.

This<a0>Numberphile video below explains fractions and<a0>Farey sequences. A Farey sequence contains all fractions between 0 and 1 with a maximum denominator. More formally, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence"" rel=""noopener"">Farey sequence</a> of order <em>n</em> is the sequence of completely reduced fractions between 0 and 1 which, when in lowest terms, have denominators less than or equal to $latex n$, arranged in order of increasing size. For example, the Farey Sequence with order 3 is:

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex F_3 = \Big\{ \frac{0}{1},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{1}\Big\} $</p>

These sequences can be visualised in fractal-esque Ford Circles, but before we get to this, first solve Euler problem 33.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hlvhQZIOQw

<h2>Euler Problem 33 Definition</h2>

The fraction<a0><sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub><a0>is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that<a0><sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub><a0>=<a0><sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider fractions like<a0><sup>30</sup>/<sub>50</sub><a0>=<a0><sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, to be trivial examples.

There are precisely four nontrivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=33"" rel=""noopener"">find the value of the denominator</a>.

<h2>Proposed Solution in R</h2>

To solve this problem, we create a pseudo-Farey sequence by generating all different fractions with two decimals in the numerator and denominator. The loop generates all combinations of denominators and numerators, excluding the trivial ones (multiples of 10 and 11). This solution converts the numbers to strings, strips any common duplicates, and tests the condition. The code concatenates vectors, which is not good practice. However, the loop is so short it does not matter much.

<h2>Farey Sequences and Ford Circles</h2>

Next step is to generalise Euler problem 33 and write a function to generate Farey Sequences and visualise them using Ford Circles.

The <code>farey</code> function generates a data table with the numerators (p) and denominators (q) of a Farey sequence. The function builds a list of all possible fractions for the solution space, excluding those with one as a Greatest Common Dominator, as defined by the <code>gcd</code> function.

<pre class=""lang:r decode:true"" title=""Farey Sequence"">farey &lt;- function(n) {
    fseq &lt;- list()
    fseq[[1]] &lt;- c(0, 1)

        if (a == 0) return(b)
        if (b == 0) return(a)
        gcd(b, a%%b)
    }
    for (q in 2:n) {
        for (p in 1:(q - 1)){
            if (gcd(p, q) == 1) {
                fseq[[i]] &lt;- c(p, q)
                i &lt;- i + 1
                }
        }
    }

    names(fseq) &lt;- c(""p"", ""q"")
    fseq &lt;- fseq[order(fseq$p / fseq$q), ]
    return(fseq)
}</pre>

Standard ggplot2 cannot draw circles where the radius of the circles is related to the coordinate system. I tried to use the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggforce/vignettes/Visual_Guide.html"" rel=""noopener"">ggforce</a> package to plot circles in ggplot2, but for some reason, I was not able to install this package on Ubuntu. As an alternative, I used a circle function sourced from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6862742/draw-a-circle-with-ggplot2"" rel=""noopener"">StackOverflow</a>. This function is called in a for-loop to build the circles on top of the empty canvas.

5449,perspectives-on-marketing,Introduction to Perspectives on Marketing,"Perspectives on marketing is a series of video lectures by Dr <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/about/peter-prevos/"">Peter Prevos</a>. These videos are based on Peter<92>s work as a lecturer for the La Trobe University MBA. These videos describe marketing from three perspectives:

<ul>
    <li><em>Practical:</em> What marketers can do to achieve their objectives.</li>
    <li><em>Theoretical:</em> Understanding the principles of marketing.</li>
    <li><em>Normative</em>: What marketer ought to do to improve societal value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Marketing Practice</h2>

Managers want to know what they need to do next to achieve their objectives. The practice of marketing teaches managers how to decide on their next action by planning their activities, create value for customers, clients or any other beneficiary, and communicate the value proposition. Perspectives on Marketing discusses practical tools to help you create value for your customers.

<h2>Marketing Theory</h2>

Calling something theoretical is usually considered as being negative. From a scientific view, A theory is a model of reality that generalises what practitioners do. Kurt Lewin said that that <93>nothing is more practical than a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/theory/"">good theory</a><94>. Marketing theory helps us to understand marketing and practice and how marketing interacts with society. The Perspectives on Marketing channel discusses theoretical models that assist in understanding how you can create value for your customers.

<h2>Normative Marketing</h2>

Normative marketing is about what marketers ought to be doing. Intellectuals have criticised marketing for creating false needs and promoting consumerism. While these critiques are mostly correct, marketing is not inherently evil. A normative perspective helps marketers to make <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/7-graces-of-tap-water-marketing/"">ethical decisions</a>. The Perspectives on Marketing channel discusses the ethics of marketing by deciding what they ought to do.

<h2>Perspectives on Marketing Video Presentation</h2>

This presentation explains the basic principles of the three perspectives on marketing. Only through combining these three perspectives can managers develop a complete, dare I say, holistic view on business. Theory helps to inform best practice and the normative perspective limits any harm to society and the natural environment.

4995,call-centre-workforce-planning-erlang-c-in-r,Call Centre Workforce Planning Using Erlang C in R language,"We all hate the experience of calling a service provider and being placed on hold for a very long time. Organisations that take their level of service seriously plan their call centres so that the waiting times for customers is within acceptable limits. Having said this, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/scarcity-marketing/"">making people wait</a> for something can in some instances increase the level of perceived value.

Managing a call centre involves an interesting mix of rational production management and the soft skills of providing <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/service-with-a-smile-mirror-neurons/"">service with a smile</a>. The mathematical part of managing a call centre relates to planning processes and staffing levels to ensure customers have a great experience.

Call centre performance can be numerically expressed by the Grade of Service, which is the percentage of calls that are answered within a specific time, for example, 90% of calls are answered within 30 seconds. This Grade of Service depends on the volume of calls made to the centre, the number of available agents and the time it takes to process a contact.<a0>Although working in a call centre can be chaotic, the <a href=""https://www.callcentrehelper.com/erlang-c-formula-example-121281.htm"" rel=""noopener"">Erlang C<a0>formula</a> describes the relationship between the Grade of Service and these variables quite accurately.

Call centre workforce planning is a complex activity that is a perfect problem to solve in R code. This article explains how to use the Erlang C formula in the R language to manage a contact centre by calculating the number of agents needed to meet a required Grade of Service. This approach is extended with a Monte Carlo situation to understand the stochastic nature of the real world better.

<h2>The Erlang C Formula</h2>

The Erlang C formula describes the probability that a customer needs to queue instead of being immediately serviced $latex (P_w)$. This formula is closely related to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution"" rel=""noopener"">Poisson distribution</a> which describes queues such as traffic lights.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex P_w = \frac{\frac{A^N}{N!}\frac{N}{N-A}}{\Big( \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \frac{A^i}{i!} \Big)+\frac{A^N}{N!}\frac{N}{N-A}}&amp;s=2$</p>

The intensity of traffic $latex A$ is the number of calls per hour multiplied by the average duration of a call. Traffic intensity is measured in dimensionless Erlang units which expresses the time it would take to manage all calls if they arrived sequentially. The intensity is a measure of the amount of effort that needs to be undertaken in an hour. In reality, calls arrive at random times during the hour, which is where the Poisson distribution comes in. The waiting time is also influenced by the number of available operators $latex N$. The intensity defines the minimum number of agents needed to manage the workload.

We can now deconstruct this formula in a common-sense way by saying that the level of service increases as the intensity (the combination of call volume and average duration) reduces and the number of operator increases. The more staff, the higher the level of service, but precisely how many people do you need to achieve your desired grade of service efficiently?

The Grade of Service $latex S$ is a function of the outcome of the Erlang C formula ($latex P_w$), the number of agents ($latex N$), the call intensity ($latex A$), call duration ($latex \lambda$) and lastly the target answering time $latex (t$).

<p style=""text-align: center;"">$latex S = 1 - \Large[ P_w e^ {-[(N-A](t/ \lambda)]} \large]&amp;s=2$</p>

The Erlang C formula can be reworked to provide that answer. I sourced this formula from<a0><a href=""https://www.callcentrehelper.com/erlang-c-formula-example-121281.htm"" rel=""noopener"">callcenterhelper.com</a><a0>but must admit that I don' t fully understand it and will take it at face value. We now have a toolset for call centre planning which we can implement in the R language.

<h2>Erlang C in R</h2>

The Erlang C formula contains some factorials and powers, which become problematic when dealing with large call volumes or a large number of agents. The Multiple Precision Arithmetic package enables working with <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/euler-problem-20/"">large integer factorials</a>, but there is no need to wield such strong computing powers.<a0>To make life easier, the Erlang C formula includes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(unit)#Erlang_B_formula"">Erlang B formula</a>, the inverse of which can be calculated using a small loop.

This implementation is very similar to an unpublished R package by <a href=""https://github.com/phubers/erlang"" rel=""noopener"">Patrick Hubers</a>, enhanced with work from <a href=""https://www.callcentrehelper.com/erlang-c-formula-example-121281.htm"" rel=""noopener"">callcenterhelper.com</a>.<a0>This code contains four functions:

<ol>
    <li><code>intensity</code>: Determines intensity in Erlangs based on the rate of calls per interval, the total call handling time and the interval time in minutes. All functions default to an interval time of sixty minutes.</li>
    <li><code>erlang_c</code>: Calculates The Erlang C formula using the number of agents and the variables that determine intensity.</li>
    <li><code>service_level</code>: Calculates the service level. The inputs are the same as above plus the period for the Grade of Service in seconds.</li>
    <li><code>resource</code>: Seeks the number of agents needed to meet a Grade of Service. This function starts with the minimum number of agents (the intensity plus one agent) and keeps searching until it finds the number of agents that achieve the desired Grade of Service.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Call Centre Workforce Planning Using an Erlang C Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>

I have used the Erlang C model to recommend staffing levels in a contact centre some years ago. What this taught me is that the mathematical model is only the first step towards call centre workforce planning. There are several other metrics that can be built on the Erlang C model, such as average occupancy of agents and average handling time.

The Erlang C formula is, like all mathematical models, an idealised version of reality. Agents are not always available; they need breaks, toilet stops and might even go on leave. Employers call this loss of labour shrinkage, which is a somewhat negative term to describe something positive for the employee. The Erlang C model provides you with the number of 'bums on seats'.

The Erlang C formula is, like every model, not a perfect representation of reality. The formula tends to overestimate the required resources because it assumes that people will stay on hold indefinitely, while the queue will automatically shorten as people lose patience.

The number of employees needed to provide this capacity depends on the working conditions at the call centre. For example, if employees are only available to take calls 70% of their contracted time, you will need $latex 1/0.7=1.4$ staff members for each live agent to meet the Grade of Service.

Another problem is the stochastic nature of call volumes and handling times. The Erlang C model requires a manager to estimate call volume and handling time (intensity) as a static variable, while in reality, it is stochastic and subject to variation. Time series analysis can help to predict call volumes, but every prediction has a degree of uncertainty. We can manage this uncertainty by using a Monte Carlo simulation.

All the functions listed above are rewritten so that they provide a vector of possible answers based on the average call volume and duration and their standard deviation. This simulation assumes a normal distribution for both call volume and the length of each call. The outcome of this simulation is a distribution of service levels.

<h3>Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>

For example, a call centre receives on average 100 calls per half hour with a standard deviation of 10 calls. The average time to manage a call, including wrap-up time after the call, is 180 seconds with a standard deviation of 20 seconds. The centre needs to answer 80% of calls within 20 seconds. What is the likelihood of achieving this level of service?

The average intensity of this scenario is 10 Erlangs. Using the resource formula suggests that we need 14 agents to meet the Grade of Service. Simulating the intensity of the scenario 1000 times suggests we need between 6 and 16 agents to manage this workload.

<pre>resource(100, 180, 20, 80, 30)
[1] 14.0000000 0.88835
intensity_mc(100, 10, 180, 20) %&amp;amp;amp;gt;% summary()
Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
5.480 8.975 9.939 10.025 10.993 15.932
</pre>

The next step is to simulate the expected service level for this scenario. The plot visualises the outcome of the Monte Carlo simulation and shows that 95% of situations the Grade of Service is more than 77% and half the time it is more than 94%.

<pre>service_level_mc(15, 100, 10, 180, 20, 20, 30, sims = 1000) %&amp;gt;%
+ quantile(c(.05, .5, .95))
5% 50% 95%
0.7261052 0.9427592 0.9914338
</pre>

This article shows that Using Erlang C in R helps managers with call centre workforce planning. Perhaps we need a Shiny application to develop a tool to manage the complexity of these functions. I would love to hear from people with practical experience in managing call centres in how they analyse data.

6190,marketing-for-engineers,Marketing for Engineers: An Introduction,"This presentation introduces marketing for engineers by providing some insight into what marketing is and how this applies to engineering as a profession. This guest lecture formed part of the <a href=""https://www.latrobe.edu.au/students/your-course/subjects/2018/EMS2EEP"">Engineering Enterprise</a> subject at La Trobe University by Eddie Custovic.

<h2>Definition of Marketing</h2>

As an engineer with a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/useless-knowledge/"">philosophy </a>background, I used to believe that marketing is about selling people things they don t need. These words are what I told my <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/mba-deception/"">MBA</a> lecturer in my marketing subject many years ago. The late emeritus professor Rhett Walker managed to convince me otherwise, which eventually resulted in a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">PhD in the topic</a>.

When you think about marketing, you might think about advertising and brands. But there is more to marketing than selling goods and services. The word cloud below visualises <a href=""https://heidicohen.com/marketing-definition/"">72 definitions of marketing</a> collected by blogger Heidi Cohen. I analysed these definitions using data science to <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/rvest-and-tidytext/"">summarise</a> them in one image. This image is illuminating, but it does not help us to define marketing for engineers.

[caption id=""attachment_7032"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1121""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-7032"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/08/marketingcloud.png"" alt=""72 Definitions of marketing summarised."" width=""1121"" height=""1090"" /> 72 Definitions of marketing summarised.[/caption]

The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190201101014/https://www.ama.org/AboutAMA/Pages/Definition-of-Marketing.aspx"">American Marketing Association</a> provides a comprehensive definition of the subject that shows how it also relates to engineering:

<blockquote>Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.</blockquote>

The significant words in this definition are ""creating <85> value for <85> society at large"", which is precisely what engineers aim to do. Engineering is never done merely for the sake of engineering, but always to in some shape or form improve the lives of humanity. Marketing can help engineers to create products that better align with the needs and wants of the end users of their work.

<h2>Marketing For Engineers</h2>

The defining difference between marketing and engineering is that engineering uses the physical sciences to achieve its objectives while marketing implements the social sciences.

The physical and the social sciences are very different because the first is objective while the social sciences are subjective. This difference in methodology is not a value judgment but a fact. Engineers can find solutions by entering input into a model, in marketing reality cannot be so easily predicted.

What marketing and engineering have in common is that they both seek to create societal value. In the words of Phillip Kotler and Sidney Levy:[note]Kotler, P., &amp; Levy, S. J. (1969). <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11124224_Broadening_the_Concept_of_Marketing"">Broadening the concept of marketing</a>. <em>Journal of Marketing</em>, 33(January), 10<96>15.[/note]

6228,flat-earth-mathematics,Flat Earth Mathematics with examples in the R Language,"In September I am embarking on a trip around the world to speak at the 2018 <a href=""http://worldwatercongress.org/"" rel=""noopener"">World Water Congress</a> in Tokyo, visit family and friends in the Netherlands and some tourism in San Francisco. One of the workshops I speak at is about Fake News in the water industry. There are many fake stories about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">tap water</a> in circulation on the web, mainly related to the use of chlorine and fluoride. The internet provides humanity with almost unlimited knowledge, but instead, they use it to spread conspiracy theories. One of the craziest fake news trends is the flat earth conspiracy. Some of you might ask whether my trip actually <em>around</em> the world or am I travelling across a <em>flat disk</em>?

This article discusses flat earth mathematics, and how to convert and visualise map projections in R. This article uses the code I published earlier in articles about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/pacific-island-hopping/"">creating flight maps</a> and <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/pacific-island-hopping/"">Pacific island hopping</a>. You can view the code below or download the full version from <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/blob/master/Geography/flatearth.R"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>.

<h2>The Flat Earth</h2>

YouTube contains thousands of videos from people that claim the earth is flat. These people pontificate that science as we know it is a ""globalist conspiracy"". While their claims are hilarious, people that believe our planet is flat are often passionate and even conduct simple experiments and engage in naive flat earth mathematics.

Adherents to the idea that the world is flat often propose <a href=""https://amzn.to/2Pxh3I7"" rel=""noopener"">Gleason's Map</a> as their version of the correct representation of our planet. This map is not a map of the flat earth but a polar <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection"" rel=""noopener"">Azimuthal equidistant projection</a> of the globe. Even though the map itself states that it is a projection of the world, flat earth believers nevertheless see it as a literal representation of the world they live on.

<img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7614"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/09/gleasons_map.jpg"" alt=""Gleason's Map is often touted as a map of the flat earth."" width=""1658"" height=""1146"" />

Their belief is based on an appeal to common sense as they can see that the world is flat with their own eyes. The second ingredient is a deep distrust in science, often inspired by religious motives.

This article shows two different ways to look at the earth and show that the spherical model better fits the reality of my trip around the world.

Projecting the spherical earth on a flat surface is a complex task which will always require compromise as it is impossible to truthfully draw the surface of the globe on a piece of paper. The video below provides a practical introduction to map projections that show how maps are stretched to display them on a flat surface.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIID5FDi2JQ

We can recreate Gleason's map with <a href=""https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html"" rel=""noopener"">ggplot</a>, which incorporates the <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapproj/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">mapproj package</a> to show maps in various projections. The Azimuthal equidistant method is popularised in the flag of the United Nations. Antarctica is in this projection displayed as a ring around the world. Flat earth evangelists believe that the South Pole a ring of ice that prevents us from proceeding beyond the disc. The edge of this disc cannot be shown because this method projects the south pole at an infinite distance from the centre of the map.

The <a href=""https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_map.html"" rel=""noopener"">coord_map</a> function allows you to change projections. The orientation argument defines the centre point of the projection. The most common location is the North Pole (90, 0). The third value gives the clockwise rotation in degrees. Gleason's map uses a rotation of 270 degrees.

<h2>My Round-the-World Itinerary</h2>

My trip will take me from Australia to Japan, from where I go to the Netherlands. The last two legs will bring me back to Australia via San Francisco.

The itinerary is stored in a data frame, and the ggmap package geocodes the longitude and latitude of each of the locations on my trip. You will need a Google API to enable the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/geocoding-with-ggmap/"">geocoding function</a>.

As the earth is a sphere, an intermediate point needs to be added for trips that pass the dateline, as I explained in my article about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/create-air-travel-route-maps/"">flight maps</a>.

I visualised the itinerary using the same method as above but centring on Antarctica. The geosphere package helps to estimate the total travel distance, which is approximately 38,995 km, slightly less than a trip around the equator. This distance is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance"" rel=""noopener"">great circle distance</a>, which is the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, adjusted for a spheroid (a flattened sphere).

The flight paths on this map are curved because of the inevitable distortions when projecting a sphere on a flat surface.

<h2>Flat Earth Mathematics</h2>

If the Gleason map were an actual map of the flat earth, then the flight paths on the map would show as straight lines.

The <a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapproj/index.html"" rel=""noopener"">mapproj package</a> contains the mapproject function that calculates the projected coordinates based on longitude and latitude. The output of this function is a grid with limits from $latex -\pi$ to $latex \pi$. The first part of the code converts the longitude and latitude from the world data frame to projected coordinates.

A line from the lon/lat 0,0 to the north pole has a projected distance of $latex \pi/2$, which in the spherical world is $latex \pi / 2 * 6378.137 = 10018.75$ km. We need to multiply the Euclidean distances with the radius of the Earth to derive the Gleason map coordinates.

This last code snippet converts the world map to flat earth coordinates. It calculates the Euclidean distance between the points on the itinerary and multiplies this with the Earth's diameter.

This last code snippet shows why the Gleason map is not a map of a flat earth. On this map, the shortest distance between Sydney and Santiago de Chili is about 25,000 km, more than twice the real value. The <a href=""https://www.travelmath.com/from/Sydney,+Australia/to/Santiago,+Chile"" rel=""noopener"">real travel time</a> is about 14 hours, which implies that passenger jets break the sound barrier. This problem exists for journeys along the lines of latitude in the Southern hemisphere. The distortion in this projection increases with the distance from the centre of the map.

This map looks like the first one, but the coordinate system is now Euclidean instead of longitudes and latitudes, as indicated by the square grid. On a projected map, the shortest distance is a curved line, parallel to Antarctica, which is how ships and aeroplanes move between these cities.

[caption id=""attachment_6853"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1048""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-6853"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/09/flatearth.png"" alt=""Sydney to Santiago de Chili on a flat earth map."" width=""1048"" height=""1048"" /> Sydney to Santiago de Chili on a flat earth map.[/caption]

This article proves that the Gleason map is not a representation of a flat earth. Aeroplanes would have to break the sound barrier to fly these distances in the time it takes to travel. Whichever way you project the globe on a flat map will lead to inevitable distortions. The Gleason map itself mentions that it is a projection.

However, these facts will not dissuade people from believing in a flat earth. I am after all an engineer and thus part of the globalist science conspiracy.

6842,geocoding-with-ggmap,Geocoding with ggmap and the Google API,"Some of the most popular articles on the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/the-devil-is-in-the-data/"">Devil is in the Data</a> show how to visualise spatial data creatively. In the old days, obtaining latitude and longitude required a physical survey, with Google maps, this has become a lot easier.</p>

The geocode function from the ggmap package extracts longitude and latitude from Google maps, based on a location query. The example below shows the result of a simple geocoding call for the White House and Uluru. The geocode function essentially constructs a URL to obtain the data.

<pre class=""wp-block-preformatted lang:r decode:true"">library(ggmap)
geocode(c(""White House"", ""Uluru""))

Source : https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=White%20House

1 -77.03653  38.89768
2 131.03688 -25.34443</pre>

In the middle of 2018, Google recently tightened access to the database, which means you need to register an API for it to work. This article explains how to use the latest version of ggmap and a Google account to continue using this function.

<h2>The Google API</h2>

Before we can start geocoding, we need to obtain an <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key"" rel=""noopener"">API key from Google</a>. Go to the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/#get-started"">registration page</a>, and follow the instructions (select all mapping options). The geocoding API is a free service, but you nevertheless need to associate a credit card with the account.

Please note that the Google Maps API is <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/usage-and-billing"" rel=""noopener"">not a free service</a>. There is a free allowance of 40,000 calls to the geocoding API per month, and beyond that calls are $0.005 each.

<h2>Geocoding with ggmap</h2>

You will need to ensure that you have the latest version of ggmap installed on your system. The current version on CRAN is 3.0.

The code snippet below shows a minimum-working-example of how you can map coordinates using ggplot. The <code>register_google</code> function stores the API key. I have stored the key itself in a private text file. The <code>getOption(""ggmap"")</code> function summarises the Google credentials to check how you are connected.

The geocode function converts the request into a URL and captures the output into a data frame. The plot shows the places I have lived, projected orthogonally on the globe.

<pre class=""wp-block-preformatted lang:r decode:true"">library(tidyverse)

This article translates the<a0><em>Gravedigger</em> game from the 1983 <a href=""https://usborne.com/browse-books/features/computer-and-coding-books/"" rel=""noopener"">Creepy Computer Games</a> book to celebrate Halloween.<a0> This article is part of my series on <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tag/r-games/"">gaming with the R language</a>.

In the 1980s I spent my time writing code on my 8-bit ZX81 and Atari computers. I learnt everything I know about programming from copying and modifying printed code listings from books with computer games. The games in these books are mostly simple text-based games, but the authors gave them enticing names, often imaginatively illustrated to visualise the virtual world they represent. A <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/pong/"">line and a dot</a> become a game of tennis, and a computer that was able to play <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tic-tac-toe-minimax-algorithm/"">Tic Tac Toe</a> seemed like your machine had come alive.

<h2>Creepy Computer Games in R</h2>

The old books by Usborne publishing are unique because it contains several versions of each program to ensure compatibility with some of the many dialects of the BASIC language. I first entered this code into the <a href=""https://atari800.github.io/"">atari800 emulator</a> to test what it does, after which I converted it to the R language.

Let's step into the creepy world of computer games as imagined by Usborne Publishing.

<h2>Gravedigger</h2>

Gravedigger by Alan Ramsey is a typical example of the games listed in the books of the early days of home computing. You can download the original book for free from the <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxv0SsvibDMTRUl3SFRONGN0MFk/view"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">publisher 's Google drive</a>. The <em>Gravedigger</em> listing starts on page 10. The lyrical description of the game provides the instructions:

<blockquote>It's dark and windy<97>not the kind of night to be lost in a graveyard, but that's where you are. You have until midnight to find your way out. Skeletons lurk in the shadows waiting to scare you to death should you come to close. You can dig holes to help keep them away but digging is tiring work and you cannot manage more than five in one game.<a0> You have to be careful not to fall down the holes you have dug. Grave stones (marked <code>+</code>) and<a0> the walls of the graveyard (marked <code>:</code>) block your way. The holes you digs are marked <code>O</code>, you are <code>*</code> and the skeletons are <code>X</code>. See if you can escape.

[caption id=""attachment_7423"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""2000""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-7423"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/10/graveyard.jpg"" alt=""Gravedigger code snippet"" width=""2000"" height=""1200"" /> Partial page of the Gravedigger game in BASIC.[/caption]</blockquote>

I translated the BASIC code as close to the original as possible. This game is not pretty code, but it works. Some of the variable names have been changed because, in BASIC, single variables and vectors can have the same name and names of character vectors end in $. A future version of this game could use graphics as I did in the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tic-tac-toe-minimax-algorithm/"">Tic Tac Toe</a> game.

The game is quite tricky, and I have only managed to escape the graveyard once. It looks like the likelihood of success very much depends on the random distribution of the graves. Perhaps we need some machine learning to optimise strategy.

You can view the code below, or download it from <a href=""https://github.com/pprevos/r.prevos.net/tree/master/Rcade"" rel=""noopener"">GitHub</a>. I leave it up to you to deconstruct the program and safely work your way through the graveyard.

Happy Halloween!

<p>Literature reviews are the cornerstone of science. Keeping abreast of developments within any given field of enquiry has become increasingly difficult given the enormous amounts of new research. Databases and search technology have made finding relevant literature easy but, keeping a coherent overview of the discourse within a field of enquiry is an ever more encompassing task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scholars have proposed many approaches to analysing literature, which can be placed along a continuum from traditional narrative methods to systematic analytic syntheses of text using machine learning. Traditional reviews are biased because they rely entirely on the interpretation of the researcher. Analytical approaches follow a process that is more like scientific experimentation. These systematic methods are reproducible in the way literature is searched and collated but still rely on subjective interpretation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Machine learning provides new methods to analyse large swaths of text. Although these methods sound exciting, these methods are incapable of providing insight. Machine learning cannot interpret a text; it can only summarise and structure a corpus. Machine learning still requires human interpretation to make sense of the information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This article introduces a mixed-method technique for reviewing literature, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. I used this method to analyse literature published by the International Water Association as part of my dissertation into <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">water utility marketing</a>.

<h2>A literature review with RQDA</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The purpose of this review was to ascertain the relevance of marketing theory to the discourse of literature in water management. This analysis uses a sample of 244 journal abstracts, each of which was coded with the <a href=""http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/"" rel=""noopener"">RQDA</a> library. This library provides functionality for <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/qualitative-data-science/"">qualitative data analysis</a>. RQDA provides a graphical user interface to mark sections of text and assign them to a code, as shown below.</p>

<p>This bar chart tells us that the literature is preoccupied with asset management and the quality of the product (water) or the service (customer perception).

<h2>Discourse Network Analysis</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We can view each abstract with two or more topics as a network where each topic is connected. The example below shows four abstracts with two or more codes and their internal networks.</p>

<p>We can create a network of topics with the <a href=""http://igraph.org/r/"" rel=""noopener"">igraph package</a>. The first step is to create a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix"" rel=""noopener"">Document-Term-Matrix</a>. This matrix counts how often a topic occurs within each abstract. From this matrix, we can create a graph by transforming it into an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix"" rel=""noopener"">Adjacency Matrix</a>. This matrix describes the graph which can be visualised and analysed.

7477,spreadsheets-for-data-science,5<bd> Reasons to Ditch Spreadsheets for Data Science: Code is Poetry,"When I studied civil engineering some decades ago, we solved all our computing problems by writing code. Writing in BASIC or PASCAL, I could quickly perform fundamental engineering analysis, such as reinforced concrete beams, with my home-brew software library. Soon after I started my career, spreadsheets became widely available, and I fully embraced this fantastic business tool, first Lotus 123 and later grudgingly moved to MS Excel.
[caption id=""attachment_7627"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""501""]<img class="" wp-image-7627"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2018/12/wapening.jpg"" alt=""Screendump of Atari BASIC program to estimate concrete reinforcement surface area."" width=""501"" height=""301"" /> Screendump of Atari BASIC program to estimate concrete reinforcement surface area.[/caption]</p>

Spreadsheets were excellent in those early days because data, code, visualisations and tabular output are all stored in one convenient file. Creating graphs with computer code was a bit of a nightmare in those days, so spreadsheets were a minor miracle. The next twenty years, I must have created thousands of spreadsheets of varying complexity. I even developed a <91>jungle<92> of interlinked spreadsheets to manage progress reporting.

In the pioneering days of spreadsheets, they provided enormous convenience for engineers and other professionals to quickly develop analytical tools. But after using this tool for a few years, cracks started to appear.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDvbDiJZpy0

<h2>Spreadsheets are Chaos</h2>

Throughout my career, I had many nightmarish experiences trying to reverse engineer spreadsheets, even the ones I wrote myself. The combination of data, code and output that I loved at the start of my career was reaching its limits. Spreadsheets use incomprehensible names for variables (<code>AZ346</code>, <code>XC89</code> and so on) and the formulas are impossible to read because all code is cramped on one line with deeply nested logic. The multiple parentheses make Excel formulas are even harder to read than LISP expressions.

Furthermore, spreadsheets hide the formulas behind the results, which renders spreadsheets notoriously hard to understand. My love affair with the spreadsheet came to an end when I started writing my dissertation about <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">customer service for water utilities</a>. Excel was incapable of helping me with the complex machine learning I needed to draw my conclusions. A colleague suggested I look into this new thing called 'Data Science' and this advice changed my career.

My focus is to implement <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/strategic-data-science/"">strategic data science</a> to help organisations to create value from data. One of the ways to achieve this goal is to ditch the spreadsheet and start writing code instead.

<h2>Code is Poetry</h2>

I decided to learn how to write code in the R language for statistical analysis. The R language is like a Swiss army chainsaw for engineers with capabilities that far exceed anything a spreadsheet can do. Writing in code, such as R or Python, is like writing an instruction manual on how to analyse data. Anyone who understands the language will be able to know how you derived your conclusions. Modern data science languages can generate print-quality visualisations and can output results in many formats, including a spreadsheet. In my job as a <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/data-science-strategy-water-utilities/"">data science manager for a water utility</a> I use R code for everything. The awesome power of being able to easily combine large data sets, visualise data and undertake complex analysis. Now that I have rediscovered the poetry of writing computer code, I advocate learning to use R or perhaps Python and ditch the spreadsheet. On my <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/devil-is-in-the-data/"">data science blog</a>, I share examples of creating value and having fun with the R language. The only purpose I still have for spreadsheets is an interface for small data sets.

<h2>5<bd> Reasons to Ditch the Spreadsheet</h2>

If you are still using spreadsheets, or you are trying to convince a colleague to ditch this tool, here are 5<bd> reasons to start using code to analyse data:

<ol>
<li>Good analysis is reproducible and can be peer-reviewed. Spreadsheets are hard to understand because of non-sequential references. Computer code is like an instruction book that can be read step-by-step.</li>
<li>Spreadsheet variables are hard to understand (e.g. <code>ZX81:ZX99</code>). In computer code, you give them meaningful names (e.g. <code>sales[81:99]</code>).</li>
<li>Best practice in data management is to separate data, code and output. In spreadsheets, it is not immediately clear which cell is the result of another cell and which ones are raw data. Computer code separates the data from the code and the output.</li>
<li>You can only share spreadsheet output with people who have access to the relevant software package. Computer code can produce output in <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/r-sweave-and-latex/"">multiple formats, such as HTML, PDF</a> or even Excel, including <a href=""https://shiny.rstudio.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">interactive dashboards</a> you can publish on the web.</li>
<li>Functionality in spreadsheets is limited to what is made available by Microsoft. The R and Python languages are extendable and have extensive libraries to solve complex problems.</li>
</ol>

The bonus reason to ditch the spreadsheet is that the best data science software, such as R and Python, is Open Source and freely available on the web. No license fees and it comes with terrific community support. Feel free to leave a comment if you like to defend the spreadsheet. If you have additional reasons to ditch this venerable but largely obsolete tool.

7657,measuring-consumer-involvement,Factor Analysis in R with Psych Package: Measuring Consumer Involvement,"The first step for anyone who wants to promote or sell something is to understand the psychology of potential customers. Getting into the minds of consumers is often problematic because measuring psychological traits is a complex task. Researchers have developed many parameters that describe our feelings, attitudes, <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/free-personality-test/"">personality</a> and so on. One of these measures is consumer involvement, which is a measure of the attitude people have towards a product or service.

The most common method to measure psychological traits is to ask people a battery of questions. Analysing these answers is complicated because it is difficult to relate the responses to a survey to the software of the mind. While the answers given by survey respondents are the directly measured variables, what we like to know are the hidden (latent) states in the mind of the consumer. Factor Analysis is a technique that helps to discover latent variables within a responses set of data, such as a customer survey.

The basic principle of measuring consumer attitudes is that the consumer's state of mind causes them to respond to questions in a certain way. Factor analysis seeks to reverse this causality by looking for patterns in the responses that are indicative of the consumer's state of mind. Using a computing analogy, factor analysis is a technique to reverse-engineer the source code by analysing the input and output.

This article introduces the concept of consumer involvement and how it can be predictive of other important marketing metrics such as service quality. An example using data from tap water consumers illustrates the theory. The data collected from these consumers is analysed using factor analysis in R, using the <a href=""https://personality-project.org/r/"" rel=""noopener"">psych package</a>.

<h2>What is Consumer Involvement?</h2>

Involvement is a marketing metric that describes the relevance of a product or service in somebody<92>s life. <a href=""http://www.sfu.ca/~zaichkow/research.html"" rel=""noopener"">Judy Zaichkowsky</a> defines consumer involvement formally as <93>a person<92>s perceived relevance of the object based on inherent needs, values, and interests<94>. People who own a car will most likely be highly involved with purchasing and driving the vehicle due to the money involved and the social role it plays in <a href=""https://horizonofreason.com/first-law-of-consumer-behaviour/"" rel=""noopener"">developing their public self</a>. Consumers will most likely have a much lower level of involvement with the instant coffee they drink than with the clothes they wear.

From a managerial point of view, involvement is crucial because it is causally related to willingness to pay and perceptions of quality.<a0> Consumers with a higher level of involvement are willing to pay more for a service and have a more favourable perception of quality. Understanding <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/tap-water-involvement/"">involvement in the context of urban water supply</a> is also important because sustainably managing water as a common pool resource requires the active involvement of all users.

The level of consumer involvement depends on a complex array of factors, which are related to psychology, situational factors and the marketing mix of the service provider. The lowest level of involvement is considered a state of inertia which occurs when people habitually purchase a product without comparing alternatives.

Cult products have the highest possible level of involvement as customers are fully devoted to a particular product or brand. Commercial organisations use this knowledge to their advantage by maximising the level of consumer involvement through branding and advertising. This strategy is used effectively by the <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/bottled-water-marketing/"">bottled water industry</a>. Manufacturers focus on enhancing the emotional aspects of their product rather than on improving the cognitive elements. Water utilities tend to use a reversed strategy and emphasise the cognitive aspects of tap water, the pipes, plants and pumps, rather than trying to create an emotional relationship with their consumers.

<h2>Measuring Consumer Involvement</h2>

Asking consumers directly about their level of involvement would not lead to a stable answer because each respondent will interpret the question differently. The best way to measure psychological states or psychometrics is to ask a series of questions that are linguistically related to the topic of interest.

The most cited method to measure consumer involvement in the Personal Involvement Index, developed by Judy Zaichowsky. This index is a two-dimensional scale consisting of:

<ul>
    <li>cognitive involvement (importance, relevance, meaning, value and need)</li>
    <li>affective involvement (involvement, fascination, appeal, excitement and interest).</li>
</ul>

The survey instrument consists of ten semantic-differential items. A Semantic Differential is a type of a rating scale designed to measure the meaning of objects, events or concepts. The concept that is being measured, such as involvement, is translated into a list of several synonyms and their associated antonyms.

In the involvement survey, participants are asked to position their views between two extremes such as Worthless and Valuable or Boring and Interesting. The level of involvement is defined as the sum of all answers, which is a number between 10 and 70.

<h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>

For my dissertation about c<a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/invisible-water-utility/"">ustomer service in water utilities</a>, I measured the level of involvement that consumers have with tap water. 832 tap water consumers completed this survey in Australia and the United States.

This data set contains other information, and the code selects only those variable names starting with ""<em>p</em>"" (for Personal Involvement Inventory). Before any data is analysed, customers who provided the same answer to all items, or did not respond to all questions, are removed as these are most likely invalid responses., which leaves 757 rows of data.

A boxplot is a convenient way to view the responses to multiple survey items in one visualisation. This plot immediately shows an interesting pattern in the answers. It seems that responses to the first five items were generally higher than those for the last five items. This result seems to indicate a demarcation between cognitive and affective involvement.

[caption id=""attachment_7664"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""905""]<img class=""wp-image-7664 size-large"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2019/01/involvement_explore-1024x1024.png"" alt=""Responses to Personal Involvement Index by tap water consumers."" width=""905"" height=""905"" /> Responses to Personal Involvement Index by tap water consumers.[/caption]

Next step in the exploratory analysis is to investigate how these factors correlate with each other. The correlation plot below shows that all items strongly correlate with each other. In correspondence with the boxplots above, the first five and the last five items correlate more strongly with each other. This plot suggests that the two dimensions of the involvement index correlate with each other.

<h2>Factor Analysis in R</h2>

Factor Analysis is often confused with Principal Component Analysis because the outcomes of are very similar when applied to the same data set. Both methods are similar but have a different purpose. Principal Component Analysis is a data-reduction technique that serves to reduce the number of variables in a problem. The specific purpose of Factor Analysis is to uncover latent variables. The mathematical principles for both techniques are similar, but not the same and should not be confused.

One of the most important decisions in factor analysis is to decide how to rotate the factors. There are two types: orthogonal or oblique. In simple terms, orthogonal rotations seek to reduce the correlation between dimensions and oblique rotation allow for dimensions to relate to each other. Given the strong correlations in the correlation plot and the fact that both dimensions measure involvement, this analysis uses oblique rotation. The visualisation below shows how each of the items how, and the two dimensions relate to each other.

[caption id=""attachment_7670"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""558""]<img class=""wp-image-7670 size-full"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2019/01/involvement_factors.png"" alt=""Factor analysis in R with Psych package"" width=""558"" height=""585"" /> Factor analysis in R with Psych package.[/caption]

This simple exploratory analysis shows the basic principle of how to analyse psychometric data. The psych package has a lot more specialised tools to dig deeper into the information. This article has not assessed the validity of this construct, or evaluated the reliability of the factors. Perhaps that is for a future article.

<h2>What is Data Science?</h2>

The term data science emerged in the middle of the last century when electronic computation first became a topic of study. In those days, the discipline was literally a science of storing and manipulating data. The current definition has drifted away from this initial academic activity to business activity. The present data science hype can be traced back to an article in the 2012 edition of <a href=""https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century"" rel=""noopener"">Harvard Business Review</a>. Davenport and Patil proclaimed data scientist to be the sexiest job of the twenty-first century. In the wake of this article, the number of data science searches in Google increased rapidly.

Organisations have for a long time used data to improve the lives of their customers, shareholders or society overall. Management gurus promoted concepts such as the data-driven organisation, evidence-based management, business intelligence and Six Sigma to help businesses realise the benefits of their data. Data science is an evolution of these methods enabled by the data revolution.

<h3>The Data Revolution</h3>

Recent developments in information technology have significantly improved what we can do with data, resulting in what we now know as data science. Firstly, most business processes are managed electronically, which has exponentially increased the amount of available data. Developments in communication, such as the Internet of Things and personal mobile devices, have significantly reduced the price of collecting data.

Secondly, the computing capabilities on the average office worker's desk outstrip the capabilities of the supercomputers of the past. Not only is it cheaper to collect vast amounts of electronic data, but processing these enormous volumes has also come within reach of the average office worker.

Lastly, developments in applied mathematics and open source licensing have accelerated our capabilities in analysing this data. These new technologies allow us to discover patterns that were previously invisible. Most tools required to examine data are freely available on the internet with a helpful community sharing knowledge on how to use them.

These three developments enabled an evolution from traditional business analysis to data science. Data science is the strategic and <em>systematic</em> approach to analysing data to achieve organisational objectives using electronic computing. This definition is agnostic of the promises of machine learning and leverages the three developments mentioned above. Data science is the next evolution in business analysis that maximises the value we can extract from data.

<h3>Data Science Strategy Competencies</h3>

The craft of data science combines three different competencies. Data scientist Drew Conway visualised the three core competencies of data science in a <a href=""http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram"" rel=""noopener"">Venn diagram</a>.

[caption id=""attachment_7744"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""443""]<img class=""wp-image-7744"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2019/02/figure03_Conway_300dpi-1024x893.png"" alt=""Data Science Venn Diagram"" width=""443"" height=""386"" /> Data Science Venn Diagram (Conway, 2010).[/caption]

Firstly and most importantly, data science requires <em>domain knowledge</em>. Any analysis needs to be grounded in the reality it seeks to improve. Subject-matter expertise is necessary to make sense of the investigation. Professional expertise in most areas uses <em>mathematics</em> to understand and improve outcomes. New mathematical tools expand the traditional approaches to develop a deeper understanding of the domain under consideration. <em>Computer science</em> is the competency that binds the available data with mathematics. Writing computer code to extract, transform and analyse data to create information and stimulate knowledge is an essential skill for any data scientist.

<h2>Good Data Science</h2>

To create value with data, we need to know how to create or recognise good data science. The second chapter uses three principles originally introduced two thousand years ago by Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius. He wrote that buildings need to be <em>useful</em>, <em>sound</em> and <em>aesthetic</em>. These requirements are also ideally suited to define best-practice in data science.

[caption id=""attachment_7745"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""401""]<img class=""wp-image-7745"" src=""https://lucidmanager.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/sites/4/2019/02/figure04_Vitrivius_300dpi-1024x888.png"" alt=""The Vitruvian triangle for data science."" width=""401"" height=""348"" /> The Vitruvian triangle for data science.[/caption]

For data science to be useful, it needs to contribute to the objectives of an organisation positively. It is in this sense that data science is an applied science and not an academic pursuit. The famous Data-Information-Knowledge pyramid visualises the process of creating value from data.

<h3>Usefulness</h3>

<em>Useful</em> data science meaningfully improves our reality through data. Data is a representation of either a social or physical reality. Any data source is ever only a sample of the fullness and complexity of the real world. Information is data imbued with context. The raw data collected from reality needs to be summarised, visualised and analysed for managers to understand the reality of their business. This information increases knowledge about a business process, which is in turn used to improve the reality from which the data was collected. This feedback loop visualises the essence of analysing data in businesses. Data science is a seductive activity because it is reasonably straightforward to create impressive visualisations with sophisticated algorithms. If data products don't improve or enlighten the current situation, they are in essence useless.

<h3>Soundness</h3>

Data science needs to be <em>sound</em> in that the outcomes are valid and reliable. The validity and reliability of data are where the science meets the traditional approaches to analysing data. Validity is the extent to which the data represents the reality it describes. The reliability of data relates to the accuracy of the measurement. These two concepts depend on the type of data under consideration. Measuring physical processes is less complicated than the social aspects of society. Validity and reliability are in essence a sophisticated way of expressing the well-known Garbage-In-Garbage-Out principle.

The soundness of data science also relates to the reproducibility of the analysis to ensure that other professionals can review the outcomes. Reproducibility prevents that the data and the process by which it was transformed and analysed become a black-box where we have no reason to trust the results. Data science also needs to be sound concerning the governance of the workflow. All data sources need to be curated by relevant subject matter experts to ensure their validity and reliability. Data experts provide that the data is available to those who need it.

<h3>Aesthetics</h3>

Lastly, data science needs to be <em>aesthetic</em> to ensure that any visualisation or report is easy to understand by the consumer of the analysis. This requirement is not about beautification through infographics. Aesthetic data products minimise the risk or making wrong decisions because the information is presented without room for misinterpretation. Any visualisation needs to focus on telling a story with the data. This story can be a comparison, a prediction, a trend or whatever else is relevant to the problem.

One of the essential principles of aesthetic data science is the data-to-pixel ratio. This principle means that we need to maximise the ratio between all the pixels on a screen and those pixels that present information. Good data visualisation practices austerity to ensure that the people that consume the information understand the story that needs to be told.

<h2>Strategic Data Science</h2>

The data science continuum is a strategic journey for organisations that seek to maximise value from data. As an organisation moves along the continuum, increased complexity is the payoff for increased value. This continuum is a hierarchy as all phases are equally important. The latter stages cannot exist without the previous ones.

Collecting data is requires important considerations on what to collect, how to collect it and at what frequency. To collect meaningful data requires a good understanding of the relationship between reality and the data. There is no such thing as raw data as all information relies on assumptions and practical limitations.

Describing the data is the first step in extracting value. Descriptive statistics are the core of most business reporting and are an essential first step in analysing the data.

Diagnostics or analysis is the core activity of most professions. Each subject area uses specialised methods to create new information from data.

Predictive analysis seems to be the holy grail for many managers. A prediction is not a perfect description of the future but provides the distribution of possible futures. Managers can use this information to change the present to construct their desired future.

Prescriptive analysis uses the knowledge created in the previous phases to automatically run a business process and even decide on future courses of action.

Any organisation starting with data science should follow the five phases in this process and not jump ahead to try to bypass the seemingly less valuable stages.

<h2>The Data-Driven Organisation</h2>

Implementing a data science strategy is more than a matter of establishing a specialised team and solve complex problems. Creating a data-driven organisation that maximises the value of data requires a whole-of-business approach that involves people with the right attitude and skills, appropriate systems and robust processes.

A data science team combines the three competencies described in the Conway Venn diagram. People that have skills in all three of these areas are rare, and the industry calls them unicorns. There is no need for recruiters to start hunting unicorns because these three areas of expertise can also exist within a team. Possibly more important than the technical skills are the social skills of a data scientist. Not only need they create useful, sound and aesthetic data science, they also need to convince the consumers of their work of its value.

One of the problems of creating value with data is ensuring that the results are implemented in the organisation. A starting point to achieve this is to ensure that the users of data products have a relevant level of data literacy. Developing data literacy among the consumers of data science is perhaps the greatest challenge. The required level of data literacy depends on the type of position and the role of the data consumer within the organisation.

Data scientists use an extensive range of tools and are often opportunistic in their choice of software. <a href=""https://lucidmanager.org/spreadsheets-for-data-science/"">Spreadsheets</a> are not very suitable to create good data science. Data science requires coding skills and the Python and R languages are powerful tools to solve complex problems. After the data specialists have developed the best way to analyse data, they need to communicate these to their customers. Many specific products exist to communicate data to users with interactive dashboards and many other dynamic systems.

The final part of this book delves into the ethics of data science. From the fact that something can be done, we cannot conclude that it should be done. Just like any other profession that impacts humans, data scientists need ethical guidelines to ensure that their activities cause no harm. This book provides some basic guidelines that can assist data scientists to assess the ethical merits of their projects."
7757,decoding-lyrics-with-songsim,Decode Lyrics in Pop Music: Visualise Prose with the Songsim algorithm,"Music is an inherently mathematical form of art. Ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras was the first to describe the logic of the scales that form melody and harmony. Numbers can also represent the rhythm of the music. Even the lyrics have a mathematical structure. Poets structure syllables and repeat words to create pleasing sounding prose. This article shows how to decode lyrics from pop songs and visualise them using the Songsim method to analyse their metre.

<h2>Decode Lyrics using the Songsim algorithm</h2>

Data visualiser, pop music appreciator and machine learner <a href=""https://twitter.com/HalfEatenScone"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Colin Morris</a> has extensively analysed the repetitiveness of song lyrics. Colin demonstrated that lyrics are becoming more repetitive since the early days of pop music. The most repetitive song is <em>Around the World</em> by Daft Punk, which should not be a surprise since the artist repeats the same phrase 144 times. <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em> by Queen has some of the least repetitive lyrics in popular music.

The TedX presentation (see below) by Colin Morris shows how he visualises the repetitiveness of song lyrics with what he calls the <a href=""https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Songsim</a> algorithm. The more points in the graph, the more often a word is repeated.

<h2>The visual language of song lyrics</h2>

Morris decided to use a self-similarity matrix, used to visualise DNA sequences, to decode lyrics. In this method, the individual words of the song are the names of the columns and the names of the rows in a matrix. For every point in the song where the row name equals the column name, shows a dot. By definition, the diagonal of every similarity matrix is filled. The timeline of the song runs along the diagonal from top left to bottom right.

Patterns away from the diagonal represent two different points in time that have the same words. The more of these patterns we see, the more repetitive a song is. Let's demonstrate this with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3qPT30LejM"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">first words ever recorded</a> by Thomas Edison in 1877.

<blockquote>Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.</blockquote>

The similarity matrix below visualises the two first sentences of the famous nursery rhyme. It shows where the words ""Mary"", ""lamb"" and ""was"" are repeated once.

The snowflake diagrams are a visual language to decode lyrics. The verses are the gutters with only diagonal lines. A verse is not very repetitive besides some stop words. The verse repeats through the song. Many songs have a bridge that contrasts with the rest of the song. The bridge is in most songs a unique pattern with self-similarity.

The diagram below visualises the lyrics of one of the most famous pop songs ever, <em>Waterloo</em> by Abba. The first 30 words are the opening verse, which shows little repetition, other than stop words such as and the pronoun I. After that we see diagonal lines appearing that represent the repetitive use of the song title. Towards the end of the song, we see the bridge, which is like a little snowflake within the diagram.

The next section shows how to implement this approach with ggplot, scraping pop song lyrics from the azlyrics.com website.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tjFwcmHy5M

<h2>Implementing Songsim with ggplot</h2>

The code below visualises song lyrics or poetry as suggested by Colin Morris. The code uses four libraries. I use the tidyverse series of libraries because it makes life very easy. The tidytext library uses the tidyverse principles to analyse text. The old reshape2 library helps to transform a matrix, and lastly, rvest helps to scrape song lyrics from the azlyrics website.

The first function scrapes song lyrics from the azlyrics website using the artist and song as input. The first three lines clean the artist and song variables. This code removes any character that is not a number or a letter, converts to lowercase and lastly removes the definite article in the artist name. These two fields are then concatenated to create the URL, which the function prints. The remainder of the code scrapes the lyrics from the website or trips on an error 404 when it cannot find the song/artist combination.

The second function implements the Morris method to visualise the lyrics. The code extracts single words from the text and places them in a data frame (tibble). This data frame is converted to a boolean matrix that contains the visualisation.

The code looks at each word and places the value TRUE where reappears in the song. Each of the vectors is then concatenated to a matrix. Lastly, ggplot visualises the matrix is visualised as a raster.
